# Isolated Causal Effects for Natural Language

This repository contains code for the experiments in the paper Isolated Causal Effects for Natural Language. This paper introduces a method for estimating *isolated* causal effects of language-encoded interventions on external outcomes from text and describes metrics for evaluating the quality of effect estimates.

## Usage

To run the experiments described in the paper, please clone this repository and run `./run_all_amazon.sh` and `./run_all_tirzepatide.sh`.
