Once I started 5 I noticed a huge difference, huge! Im supposed to take my injection tomorrow and it’s still working pretty good today! It’s 6 pm and I have to eat dinner yet- I could go without eating honestly but I try to eat 3 times a day🤷🏻‍♀️this shot makes it so easy!  I lost 10 lbs the last  4 weeks and lost 3 lbs the first month on 2.5

I’ve had to force myself to eat. Since I am typically a healthy eater (with a horrible sweet tooth) removing the sugar and carbs is life changing. 
I have been juicing for fresh juice and vitamins. Fiber gummies are a must with Mounjaro since digestion is so slowed down, a common side effect is constipation. 
And, water.  I have been consuming a lot of water a day. 
10 lbs down in 3 weeks.

I’d say my stomach feels “tender,” maybe like I had a stomach flu and am recovering and need to be careful what I’m eating. Honestly, the metformin affects me worse. Hoping to talk my doc into letting me forgo that one and see how I do.

I was just informed today after trying to get a prior authorization that my insurance will not be covering it. I have Medicaid. My doctor offered to prescribe victoza as it may be covered, 
Does anyone have experience with victoza or how does it compare?

We went to dinner and a bar, I got 5 drinks over the course of five hours. Realistically I should be sober by now. Instead I found myself throwing up in a bar bathroom for the first time…. yikes. Be careful with your alcohol consumption, people. Consider yourself a lightweight now.

Still worth it though.

I’ve lost like 4 lbs, but it’s all water weight because I’m nauseous and have no appetite.

## Comment 
> I had been on ozempic for almost 3 years. The first year went from 250 to 165 and have maintained around 170 for the last 2 years. In March, I started to gain a bit and got around 175. First gain in over 3 years. I was on 1mg of the ozempic. 
I started using Mounjaro at 2.5 and am currently on my second done of 5mg and have gained 8 pounds! Food intake from what I can tell, has not increased since being off ozempic. I also take metformin, losartan, hctz and various vitamins. Has anyone else experienced that much weight gain on this? I also have been very swelled, numbness in my hands just like it used to be when I was much heavier, have had insomnia and depressed but unsure if the depression is from the medicine or the weight gain. Only reason I switched was insurance will pay for Mounjaro and not the ozempic and it was becoming increasingly difficult to get samples from doc like I had been for several years. Does it get better? I know oral medications will no longer absorb pretty much on this. Is that it? Since my fluid pill isn’t working I feel this way? Will that get better? I want to give it more time but I cannot continue to gain approximately 2 pounds a week. Have not had any stomach issues or anything like that.

## Comment 
> I lost 4lbs even during week one. I'm thrilled to see the downward movement of the scale but I'm still in that range that my body would normally fluctuate, so I don't consider it a huge win yet. That being said, progress is progress!

I only felt nausea a little on day 2 after my first shot. My appetite was greatly decreased but I noticed it returning around days 5 and 6.  I also noticed less upset stomach after eating than I usually have (normal since my gallbladder was removed) so I loved that. I'm sure it has to do with the gastric emptying being slowed. That seemed to change by day 6.  The weirdest thing I noticed was some sweet things tasted different, most notably clementines taste like medicine to me now. Blech. 

As far as injecting the Mounjaro, I did both in my stomach, switching sides between week one and today, week two. All I felt was a little pinch, but the injection site has felt sore afterward both times.

All in all? I am very happy.

## Comment 
> I’ve been taking the medication now for about six weeks. I had a one month check up with my doctor a week or so ago. I was down by 10 pounds and feeling a little down about it because of all of the posts that I’m reading where people are losing 30 pounds in a month. I mentioned this to my Doctor who is also taking Mounjaro. She reminded me that 10 pounds is a safe weight loss. And the slower you lose the slower you are to gain it back. Please do not be discouraged by reading that some people are losing double or triple what you are in a months time. 10 pounds in a month is a very healthy and realistic goal. Body types also make a substantial difference in the amount and how quickly you lose.

Best part was that I put on jeans this morning and they fit. Not usually the case in the fall. I’ll take it.

> I took my first shot of Mounjaro on Wednesday night. My SW was above 289, but that's just when I got my scale that records weight. My current weight is 286. It's a small change but in less than a week, for me, it's a big deal. If I'm able to get down to 270s soon, it'll be the first time in 4 years.

I just took my 6th shot and I've lost 15lbs total. I've gone from 255 to 240. 

I usually take my shot on day 6 because I was struggling on the 7th day at 2.5. I wasn't struggling with the 5mg but I had some side effects so I still took it at day six so I could recover over Sunday.

08/25: 255 - 2.5mg
08/31: 249 - 2.5mg
09/06: 246 - 2.5mg
09/12: 244 - 2.5mg
09/19: 243 - 5mg
09/25: 240 - 5mg

However…I feel super bloated. I do go to the bathroom often. Just wondering if there will be one big whoosh, or if the water is filling up my fat cells?

Any advice?

Anyone had a nosebleed taking this med?  Other than those few symptoms I’m down 4 lbs and it’s curved my food focus. I’m 75lbs overweight so could that be a reason for my doctor to prescribe the heartier dose?

## Comment 
> I took my first 5mg shot a week ago after one month on 2.5 with constant fluctuation above 400lbs after losing 26lbs on my own. This shot was painful with side effects. The first 24 hours, I was painfully disinterested in eating that worsened with the constipation I was developing. I began taking a fiber supplement and a dose of miralax helped things get back flowing. I'm also feeling incredibly weak and craving salt. Blood sugar in good control and everything else is fine thankfully so I just felt like I needed to just continue trusting the process. 

I'm glad I did because the scale said 396. Good 4lbs this week. Finally, the cherry on top. I hope it continues and that's not all I get this month. 

Like others, I've run into problems getting my second refill. They just say I need a PA and they would reach out to my doctor. Luckily, I have 3 more weeks to get this sorted out. 

So that's all. Just wanted to share my little happiness.

## Comment 
> I’m not OP. But I too switched from Ozempic to MJ in September. MJ is so much better in so many ways. I would get stomach pains with OZ and it lost effectiveness quickly for me. With MJ I’ve only had injection site itchiness for a few days and supreme appetite suppression and weightloss never felt better in my life I’m down 48 pounds so far. Highly recommend. MJ has superior appetite suppression IMHO.

I’ve lost like 4 lbs, but it’s all water weight because I’m nauseous and have no appetite.

## Comment 
> Well I’m not a fan of 5mg.  I’ve gained a pound this week. Yes I know…1lb gained isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things but dang! I want the number going down not up!  I heard the 5mg dose is often a stagnant situation but I was hoping I would be one of the lucky people that continue losing lol

This week went really well! No nausea, no extra hunger on day 5-6, and energy is up! Last week I lost 7 pounds and this week I lost 3! I'm currently wanting to lose 2.5 pounds a week so anything above that is a win for me! I need to work on drinking more water though. That'll definitely help the process along.

Now, with second injection, I’m

With MJ I’ve only had injection site itchiness for a few days and supreme appetite suppression and weightloss never felt better in my life I’m down 48 pounds so far. Highly recommend. MJ has superior appetite suppression IMHO.

## Comment 
> I naturally changed a lot just because of what agrees with me and digest.  I've landed in keto eating as a result, and that's working really well so far!  Down 18 pounds in a little over 4 weeks, just started 5 mg on Friday.  I do exercise, 3-4 times a week on my Tonal, walk for 45 minutes when the weather is good (getting a treadmill to make that happen every day!).

The exercising, as well, is pretty organic. I just feel so much better, more energetic and want to move. I find myself dancing around the house again and moving all the time when I don't have to sit for work.  It's been amazing.  It has literally changed my life back to some earlier version of myself, before the weight grounded me.

## Comment 
> Hi! I’ve not done a lot on Reddit before, just scrolling and a few posts. I was wondering how y’all got started with mounjaro? Should I just ask my pcp or is there a better way to go about it? I really feel like he’s going to be funny about it. I have health conditions that make it really hard to lose weight. 

Did keto and it was great at first, but then I just stopped losing weight (even started gaining) and I could not avoid sushi, pasta, and fruit anymore for something that wasn’t working. Switched to low calorie and it didn’t really work either. I’m at a loss, I really need some help like it seems like this medicine gives. Started at 230, got down to 189, back up to 215 for several months now. 

If there’s already posts like this (I’m sure there are) and someone could help explain how to find them I’d greatly appreciate that too!

I've been doing really well on Mounjaro so far, it's really reduced hunger a lot and given me a lot of motivation to work out and eat right. I have noticed occasionally (maybe 1-2 a week) I will get a wave of really intense hunger. Usually, after I've eaten lunch or dinner, I'll just get a really strong craving for more food. I've usually snacked on carrots and hummus or apple and peanut butter, but it lasts a few hours sometimes.

I also occasionally get super repulsed by food, especially meat. Usually, I love steak, hamburgers, bacon, etc. But I got a hamburger two weeks ago and I took one bite and felt nauseous. I had to throw it out. In fact I had to take out my garbage, I couldn't even smell it. Other people ordered the same thing and said it smelled and tasted fine, actually really good.

I had a similar thing happen with eggs and bacon this week. Really still the thought of a hamburger or bacon kind of makes me queasy. 

Anyone else experience either of these?

Then Wednesday night kept having a lot of stomach cramps, gas and heartburn, then diarrea started off and on all day Thursday. By Thursday night it stopped. That was the only side affects so far. My goal weight is 170 pounds. I'm assuming the weight is water? Not sure I already take a water pill with my other meds. Let me know what you think please . I haven't done any other exercise and just monitor my Calories, carbs and sugar intake. I drink a slim fast protein shake every morning also.

## Comment 
> As I'm waiting for my insurance to make a decision, they now suddenly need a prior authorization after covering Mounjaro for 10 weeks, I've made some observations.  My appetite has changed,  it's come back, but it's reduced. On Mounjaro I could only eat one meal and a snack, sometimes 2 meals, but that  was only about 3 days a week. Now, I'm eating about twice a day, a little bit more than before, but nowhere near the amount I was eating before. Sweets still taste appalling(well, I can eat 3 bites, and I'm done, when I was on MJ, I could only have one bite of something like cake and that was it. I can still only handle 4 Splenda in my large unsweetened tea from McAllister. The best thing is that I don't obsess about food. I even lost 1 1/2 lbs over these last 3 weeks...I was so afraid I was going to gain weight.  But, it's been manageable. Either way, it's nice to know that for me. I feel that when I quit taking Mounjaro,  that I have hope that I'll have no huge issues maintaining my weight loss.

## Comment 
> I'm going into week four and was pleased to see the scale shows a 9 pound weight loss. However I am disappointed that I'm not seeing any changes in how my clothes fit.  My pants and tops are just as tight as always. I have been consistently eating much less than normal so I have to be losing something-- more than just water.   I'm concerned that all I am losing is muscle.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

I hardly eat anything anymore. I eat half my lunch and then the other half for dinner most of the time. We shall see what happens this week.   Oh, this is my 4th week on 5 mg.  Staying on 5mg for the next round also.

> Yes, having liver fibrosis, fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, &amp; obesity it’s been a battle. With IF strategies, &amp; complete low glycemic nutrition change four years ago, I lost 100 pounds &amp; then spotted GLP-1 drugs last spring while researching fibrosis studies. Started Mounjaro mid August. I was not going to change my nutrition, I am already near zero carbohydrate. The weight loss was way too fast on MJ, I had to increase food intake to slow it down. Total lost now is 160 pounds. I started at 410 pounds four years ago. The good news is I won’t have weight rebound. My goal is 220.

## Comment 
> My boss recently went on Mounjaro about 2.5 months ago and I am shocked how much weight he has lost.  I am guessing about 15% of his body weight.  We recently met up and he told me all about it.

I have been diagnosed as a T2 diabetic for about 12 years now.  I was able to control it quite well for many years with exercise and low carb eating but over the last couple of years, not so much.  My last A1C went from 7.1 to 10..  I went from 225 to 250.  So I am going to ask my doctor to put me on this.

One thing I like about my doc is he is very stingy about giving out prescriptions.  He does the hard work and keeps you on a minimal regiment as long as possible.  However, I am really going to push this time to get on Mounjaro after seeing not only my boss's response, but after reading post after post here about all of your experiences.

Can you all give me some advice on how you approached your doctor to get on this medication?

Thanks!

## Comment 
> I started around same weight as you. I can tell you after being on this for 6 weeks now (18 pounds lost) that I have learned these things. 

1. If you weigh over 300 pounds and are female like us, there is a big eating disorder component to our weight.  That gets magnified when you start this medicine. 
I have realized that the med definitely decreases my appetite (not significantly some days) and I get full quicker.  But my yearning for the “comfort” of food is still there.  On days I have a really stressful event I find my urge to eat is overwhelming despite not being hungry.  It has really helped me become more mindful of my relationship to food and my coping mechanisms. 

2.  The medicine has made me realize my constant hunger wasn’t my eating disorder. It was truly hormonal/ physical because the medicine IS helping physically. I do have some appetite suppression. I actually feel full after eating a normal portion of food for the first time in my life. Now I am not still hungry right after eating a meal!  **edit. There are days I am definitely hungrier than others. This is normal human existence. When we cut calories from what our bodies are used to we will still be hungry while we adjust. I still have cravings some days. 

3. The changes in my body have made me more aware of when I am longing for certain foods and the emotional ties they have…To decrease anxiety, lift my mood, cure boredom in my case.  I am going to have to work hard to replace it with something else.  Just like some people who quit smoking start chewing gum. They add in something to take the place of the thing they are giving up. That’s what I am working on now.  

4. This will take time. Some people on here start at a weight of 170-180. That’s very different than someone who weighs over 300.  There is just so much more that goes into getting to a weight that high.  It’s not going away completely with a “magic shot”.  The Mounjaro feels like a miracle in a way but in reality it’s only a tool.  The work has to be done. It’s not an “easy” way out of super morbid obesity for me.  I made an analogy to my husband. It’s like I have been told to dig a hole in the ground. I’m given a tablespoon to use as my tool at first.  I start digging but it’s almost impossible because I don’t have the right tools to conquer the hard dirt. I make some progress but it’s taking more effort and energy than I have.  It would take forever! Next I am handed an power auger (hole digger). Suddenly I have the tools to dig the hole but I am not strong because I haven’t been working out so it still takes quite a bit of work to dig the hole. Yes, it’s exponentially easier but it’s still very hard work. I also have to seek out experts to help me use the tool because I have never used it before ( counseling for anxiety, binge eating etc).  

TLDR:  MJ is a breakthrough in type 2 and obesity treatment but it’s still only a tool. It has to be used in combo with other tools to see the best results.  

Also… give it some time!  You will notice a bigger difference the longer you go!! You just got started!

Mounjaro is a fucking GAME CHANGER. I had waaaaay scarier side effects on Ozempic (constipation, heart racing, hypoglycemic symptoms, dizzy, panicky, etc) I have not had ANY of that on Mounjaro. I literally appeared thinner 48 hours after my first shot because it killed all my inflammation.  My ankles, wrists, fingers and face looked different over night. I can not say enough good things about this drug.  I lost 20lbs so far on it in just over 3 months !

## Comment 
> I just did my 7th injection (3rd of 5mg) and I’m down 21 lbs. Only 3 inches from my natural waist, but 8 inches from my belly. I don’t understand how weight decides to come off at all… I keep telling myself that lots of line is coming off around my internal organs and that’s the most important 😂

## Comment 
> Has anyone else seen a small weight gain on 5mg? It’s only 2 lbs but it’s over the last two days. I know it isn’t much so please don’t come for me. I haven’t changed anything I’ve been doing while constantly losing weight, so to see an increase on the scale is a little disappointing since I’ve been seeing a very steady decrease. I’m just wondering if it’s happened to anyone else. Today is my third shot on 5mg.

> I have found MJ makes a lot of choices for you over the last 6wks I have been on it. I have adjusted my daily diet, I crave more vegetables, I no longer desire fatty fried foods.  French fries are my favorite and I dont really want them anymore.  I have not started exercising but have increased my daily steps. My SW was 290, my CW is 270 I took my first dose 10/13/22. Even took a week long vacation to Florida that involved a lot of food last week. Still managed to loose pounds. I think if you will be fine and do great on this medication.

And for a ton of people it is a “miracle drug” I have made zero lifestyle changes in addition to adding mounjaro and I’ve lost 12% of my body weight in less than 3 months. I had an almost immediate response to the medication… lots of people do. Does everyone? No- but enough do that I’m not surprised people want to know when they can expect to feel it working.

## Comment 
> My weight has fluctuated so much in the last 4 years that I have clothes spanning 5 different sizes (went from my lowest weight since college to my highest non-pregnancy weight thanks to untreated insulin resistance). The largest 2 sizes no longer fit me thanks to the 40 pounds I've lost so far on MJ, but I find myself hesitant to get rid of them. I feel like that's silly, but I'm really scared that I will eventually lose access to this drug and gain all the weight back. 

Should I just get rid of anything that's too big on me now? What's everyone else been doing as they size out of clothes?

## Comment 
> Hello to the T2D members. Ever since starting Mounjaro close to 3 months ago, my fasting blood sugar has been in the general range of 90-110, which I think is amazing. There are some days it’s lower, some a little higher… this morning it was 154! I know it’s only one day, and probably an outlier, but that old feeling came back like “oh no, it’s high…”. I haven’t had an A1C test yet (next week) and I suspect it is going to be great, but this just made me wonder what kind of control/variability you all are seeing. For reference, in the past, I’d say my normal morning numbers were more like 120-140 with an A1C of 6.2. Also, I have lost 12 pounds over this period. Thanks for your insights!

> I did need the medication for pre-diabetes,  I didn't expect to lose so much weight so fast...I feel like I basically didn't do anything.  The medication did everything for me. I hit 189 this morning after about  12 weeks on Mounjaro(SW 255).  My fasting blood sugar is amazing always around 77-79....never seems to go over 90 after I eat. My brain is food quiet, some food I used to love is actually repulsive now. I am kinda afraid about tomorrow and attempting to eat at my inlaws, they don't know about me being on the medication or my weight-loss. The last time the saw me I was around 250.

## Comment 
> 100 pounds in 3.5 years that was slow. 50 in 3 months on Mounjaro is too fast. Trying to slow it down. Doing it with nutrition change alone was healthy but very frustrating at times. Luckily my health was improving even with slowwww loss. Health improvements are actually just as valuable. If I wasn’t losing much weight &amp; my health wasn’t improved, I would be doing it wrong. Better health brings more energy, less insulin &amp; faster metabolism weight loss, when done properly.

I do strength training twice a week, cook at home more days than not, and worked with a registered dietitian for eight months before starting MJ.

## Comment 
> Hi, I'm a 33 year old female, I just took my last 5 mg shot yesterday so this makes 7 weeks down. I started at 200 and have been fluctuating from 196 - 200 this whole time. I weighed myself yesterday and I'm at 200 again. Next week I'll start the 7.5 mg. 
I've had some nausea and constipation in the beginning but now I only have occasional nausea. I have type 2 and was in the high 300's blood sugar before starting and now I'm in the mid 100's. So I'm happy about my sugar, and feeling overall healthier.

 I never really started dieting, I was stupid and just waiting for the medicine to just do the work for me - I wanted the clear mind, not craving food, not tolerating sweets, etc. But that never happened. I don't feel as hungry, and I eat much smaller portions during a smaller window in the day. I've been doing about 30 minutes of low impact exercise 4-5 days a week. (Which I didn't do before)

I just kept telling myself that the weight will come off eventually and that I'm probably just seeing extraordinary results online, but I'm doing good and just waiting for a higher dose to help. 
But I just read some comments on a recent post about how the drug is ineffective for 9% and that a higher dose won't really help me. I tried google and can't find any info. Sequence takes a week to respond. 

I'm feeling really discouraged and disappointed because it would be just my luck to be the minority. This is the story of my life. 
I guess I'm just hoping someone has had a similar situation and can either give me hope or tell me to just quit now.

## Comment 
> I (f55 sw 283.3) lost about 19 pounds in 4 weeks. I ate 1200-1400 calories per day. I had already been working out and eating 1200-1400 calories per day, but was not losing weight. I changed nothing and did exactly what I had been doing pre-Mounjaro. Not everyone who loses a significant amount is disordered in their eating. For me the insulin resistance truly made it difficult to lose weight. Assuming everyone is eating 200 calories in a day isn’t fair to those of us who have had significant loss and are eating healthy. 

Edited to add: My doctor said at my 4 week check, that she thinks my body really ramped up since I had been eating like this prior to being put on Mounjaro and that my loss would steady itself out to a more sustainable and healthy level of progress. I had been working my ass of prior to Mounjaro and feel like the amount I lost in the first month is simply reflective of that.

I don’t eat breakfast anymore because I’m not hungry, regular lunch and dinner that’s about half of what I used to have and no snacking because again, I’m not hungry. Amazing how fast the weight comes off with this drug. I just hope it doesn’t come back as fast when you stop using it.

Y’all I have been doing really well on MJ. I’m rarely hungry and typically eat either a balanced lunch or dinner and a one small snack like yogurt or fruit. Yesterday I ate a small plate of Thanksgiving leftovers for lunch and dinner, and I am sooooo sick right now. I have the opposite of my usual constipation, severe cramping, gross burps, and terrible nausea. I didn’t stuff myself, I wasn’t overly full, and I wasn’t expecting this at all. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this to where you can only eat one main meal in a day? I feel like my body is rejecting this second meal, and I don’t ever want to feel this again.

> Mounjaro has done wonders for me:  

* my A1C dropped from 7.8 at T2D diagnosis late August to 5.6!!!
* my body weight has decreased by 18% and my BMI is borderline obese:  29.9/30.1 over the past week (was class 2 originally) 
* energy is up, resting heart rate is down
* blood pressure is down
* liver function panel showed that everything is in the normal range now 

I was on 2.5 Mg my first month, and then have been on 5 Mg since as my PCP was happy with my daily glucose readings and didn’t see a need to move up to higher doses.  

If for some reason I can’t get Mounjaro any longer my doctor has already discussed switching to Ozempic, not due to the shortages that are new but because my insurance denied my PA because I hadn’t shown ill side effects with Ozempic and Trulicity before trying Mounjaro.  My PCP originally prescribed Mounjaro because the coupon for $25 was available.  If any of that changes, not able to get the Rx or the price dramatically rises I’ll have to switch.  Now that I have my blood sugar under control I don’t want to ever go back if I can help it.

I would not be losing weight at all if I did not use WW to help me make good choices and balance my diet.

I have gained 4lbs back.  My appetite has returned.. anxiety, depression &amp; OCD is back.  I think about food all the time.  I'm a binge eater &amp; Mounjaro was amazing for that.

## Comment 
> I am a slower loser. I'm 15 weeks in and down 23lbs. However even though I'm not losing weight on the scale, my labs are better, my abdomen is no longer hard and round, it's flat and squishy lol. I'm hoping this means I'm losing visceral fat first and then the rest of the body will follow. My face is slimming and clothes fit better. I'm hoping to lose a total of 125lbs so hopefully the higher doses will get me on my way. I am just assuming I'm a slow loser because I've had insulin resistance and PCOS for quite some time and most likely need my hormones to regulate.

My appetite hasn't come back like on 2.5, but I'm definitely feeling the fatigue a little more. I lost almost 4 pounds this week, so I am very pleased with this dosage so far.

## Comment 
> One of my favorite things to see on here are success stories. They always brighten my day, so I thought I'd give a little update of my own! Last year I was morbidly obese, and now I am finally only in the overweight category! Cholesterol, blood pressure, and A1C are all great! They were able to lower my cholesterol and blood pressure meds, and I'm hoping I can be completely off of them soon. I also went shopping for jeans the other day, and I have gone from a size 22 (women) to a size 10. I almost passed out in the dressing room! It's amazing how excited I am now about life in general.

A few of my stats just to get the whole picture:
I'm 34, female, 5'3 with type 2. My heaviest weight was 240. I lost close to 40lbs before starting Mounjaro on Sept. 3rd, have lost 39lbs since starting and now weigh 164. No goal weight in mind, just trying to get down to a healthy weight!

This past week, even over Thanksgiving, I've lost 4 pounds!
29 pounds total! I'm sticking to 5mg because it suppresses my appetite all too well and helps control my blood sugar. If my weight loss stalls I'll move up to 7.5. It's weird that I'm so excited for my next blood draw to see any improvements. My body feels so much better. Back pain, knee pain, neck pain, and stomach pain are all gone! Plus my skin has cleared significantly. My inflammation is basically non existent.

So I'm trying not to stress out. My insurance doesn't cover MJ so I use the savings card. I know many of you are in this same situation. Now, am I only allowed 12 shots with the savings card or can I use it until it expires? 

I love being on this shot. With PCOS, it's been a life saver with weight loss.

## Comment 
> Hi! Good job. I had my first shot of MJ a week ago, 5.0, and it’s nothing like Ozempic. Last night I had a tough night at work, so I came home and ate cheddar cheese. Half a package (4 plus ounces, maybe more). With a glass of wine. On Ozempic it was no problem but I’ve had nausea and diarrhea for 18 hours. I also lost 1.7 pounds my first 5 days on MJ—it got me below my set point weight of 156. And my glucose is better controlled. (I’m type 2).

I’d be happy enough with a 1.25 a month loss, but I don’t know what your starting weight was. I lost 15% of my weight on Ozempic before the shortages forced me into Mounjaro. My first week I lost 1.7 pounds, reversing a 2 month stall. My goal weight loss is 1.25 pounds a month. I’m 154 pounds, started at 185 or so. Weight prior to T2 diagnosis hovered around 195-210 in the years right before. On metformin I was able to stay around 185 but I began getting sugar cravings and my A1C went up. 

How is your A1C on MJ? The weight will come off, but it’s not magic.

> The compounded Semaglutide works.  I was on it for 5 1/2 months before switching to Mj.  In that time, I lost 32 lbs, A1C dropped from 6.5 tp 5.8, Triclycerides dropped almost 50 points and liver enzymes dropped.  The reason I switched is I am T2D and found the old coupon.   When the coupon runs out, I will switch to Ozempic or Trulicity or go back to compounded Semaglutide or Compounded Tirzepatide, whatever is most cost-effective.

The compounded Semaglutide cost me $180 a vial and lasted a month and half.

Doing the research is very important.

A1c dropped from 6.5 to 5.8, triglycerides dropped almost 50 points and liver enzymes dropped.

> It’s from hunger increasing and satiety decreasing due to not having the exogenous hormones anymore. That leads to eating more calories than your body needs to run at current weight. Then weight gain. I went down in dose one month and it wasn’t effective the entire month, I gained 5 pounds.

## Comment 
> So I have not had the side effects you describe, and that would absolutely make a difference to me. As for the weight loss, though, that sounds great. I have lost 7.4 pounds in almost 8 weeks, and I am thrilled to death with the progress. In my particular case, it has been paired with demonstrably healthier behaviors-- for example, I feel like eating healthier foods.

Acid reflux which has plagued me for like a year initially got worse and since has almost completely resolved. And of course losing 25lbs in 2 and a half months has done wonders to everything.

I was 410 pounds 4 years ago, my health is better but it’s not just fat loss. I do many things to restore my health. I will be done with Mounjaro in a few months, trying to keep it slow now to avoid gallstones. Getting liver scan &amp; gallbladder check in two weeks.

LDL cholesterol was 94, now 60.

I have NEVER in the last 15 years of being T2D seen numbers like this. And have not weighed this much... little?... since I was 25 (I am now 57). YAY!

She helped me put together a meal plan, provided positive reinforcement and truly listens to me. She ran labs on me that no one ever had before even after all of my years and years of weight gain and inability to lose weight. She took the time to find out I’m insulin resistant, and even look at other things like adhd.

## Comment 
> It’s not meant to be hateful, but quietly, many diabetics are feeling like “how dare our lives matter”. It’s just few dare to say it out loud bc we get slammed with “gatekeepers! Fat shamers!” And that’s why many diabetics don’t post here anymore, they got bullied off the sub. And most agree that prediabetes needs better treatment, but this drug and Ozempic make SUCH a difference. My A1C dropped 2 percentage points. Metformin only dropped it half of a percentage point and doesn’t control glucose spikes. In prediabetes it works better. I’m so upset that more people aren’t given it earlier. I lost 10 permanent pounds on it, but by then I was full blown diabetic. I wish I had been tested for fasting insulin and given metformin when I was 25, when I was 133 pounds. I feel it could have avoided the weight gain and the diabetes.

## Comment 
> I’ve had a long history of disordered eating since I was a child. I was chubby as a child, very thin from my teenage years until I was about 20. Then after college, I was on a frequent roller coaster of fad diets trying to prevent diabetes when I get older. All that frequent weight cycling (loss then gain then loss then gain over and over again) is also a risk for diabetes. I went from weighing 106lbs to 250 at my heaviest. I even did keto and intermittent fasting and still gained the weight back.

I didn’t start losing weight until I stopped fad dieting. I lost 25lbs. I maintained that weight loss. Then I found out I had type 2 diabetes. I never even had pre diabetes. Lost another 10lbs after being on ozempic for a year. It was a wonder drug with keeping my blood sugar under control and helping me lower my A1C. I’m glad I was able to get on mounjaro and started it today.

There are also thin people in my family that also have type 2 diabetes, so it’s not exclusively a fat people disease. It’s also genetic.

I wish I had never jumped on the fad diet and intermittent fasting bandwagon. All dieting did was cause me to lose and regain weight over and over again starting at 106lbs and getting all the way to 250lbs. I fluctuate within 210-215lbs these days.

I know if I never dieted and stayed thin, I likely would have gotten T2D anyway, but not until I got older.

If anything caused me to get type 2 diabetes, it was every type of restrictive dieting including keto and intermittent fasting and genetics for sure.

I no longer diet. My weight loss progress is extremely slow and I prefer it that way because I want my weight loss to be permanent.

I was super nauseous the first few days, but never not hungry. Now I'm just hungry all the time. Has anyone else had a similar experience after increase their dose? I'm wondering if it's just from the switch and will be better next week, or if I need to think about going down to the 2.5.

My insurance have been covering the prescription every month with no issues. I can’t find one single pharmacy that will fill it without the dx code now. 
It’s so frustrating to see a pharmacy pigeon hold a medication that my dr prescribed and my insurance agrees to pay for.
I have one last hope for a pharmacy (my dr is tired of resending them a bunch of places) before I give up and try something else.
I’ve tried multiple other types and have had the worst side effects that I can’t stand to be on them. 
Thanks for letting me vent.

I’m down 11 lbs and have stalled the last 3 days. I think I’m not eating enough. 3rd shot tonight and going to try to up my calorie intake a bit and see if I can’t lose a little more.

> Addiction is something I am very familiar with, runs in the family. Fortunately for me, I made some trade offs early. Traded sugar junk carbs, party time, smoking, alcohol &amp; recreational substances, for skiing, distance running, weight lifting, health food supplements &amp; female attentions. 

BUT Married late to a “foodie” &amp; packed it all in for sugar, junk carbs, fast food, cooking &amp; baking, collecting cookbooks &amp; recipes, &amp; watching cooking shows on television. The sugar, fruit juice, carbohydrate, junk, cake &amp; pastries almost killed me, &amp; my T2D wife. And I KNEW BETTER. Four years after I hit 410 pounds &amp; was at doctors or hospital constantly, it’s ALL GONE. 

I reversed my wife’s T2D, &amp; our food addictions. Found Mounjaro in late August, almost done now, total health makeover &amp; 160 pounds off in four years. Traded the food addictions for a daily dedication to rebuilding my health. Go big or go home has always been my motto I guess. My next liver fibroscan is in two weeks. Fingers crossed 🤞

Started 8/4/22, SW 324 CW 269. I am meticulous about food records, as I am using WW in conjunction with Mounjaro. I did not lose any weight the entire month of November. I was SO frustrated. But I am back to losing about 3 pounds a week. I honestly think my body just had to kind of recalibrate itself into being a ""smaller"" person. Keep your eye on the prize!!

## Comment 
> I’m not OP. But I too switched from Ozempic to MJ in September. MJ is so much better in so many ways. I would get stomach pains with OZ and it lost effectiveness quickly for me. With MJ I’ve only had injection site itchiness for a few days and supreme appetite suppression and weightloss never felt better in my life I’m down 48 pounds so far. Highly recommend. MJ has superior appetite suppression IMHO.

## Comment 
> I started Mounjaro 16 weeks ago, well, I technically missed 4 weeks due to some insurance issues,  but  within those first 12 doses I went from 257 to 185, 187. Currently I'm at 181. But, I wanted to know what can happen to the body from rapid weight loss and if any of you are experiencing anything, and what should I be on the lookout for.

I'm also curious about how diabetes works, as in, I was diagnosed a few years ago with T2D, but I managed to lose some weight and then my doctor said it was gone and I was fine....2014, I was pregnant and dr was convinced I had T2D, but, after baby was born and I lost a little weight, Dr said I was fine again. But, I hear it never goes away, just goes into remission.  Now, my current dr says I'm pre-diabetic,  so I'm just kinda confused.

I took shot #2 of my 2nd month at 5.0mg on Friday. I am down 30 lbs over 10 weeks! My doctor is so excited for me. I had my labs done yesterday, and I'm so excited! 

A1C  from 6.1 --&gt; 5.5

fasting blood glucose from high 120s to mid-80s (85 for labs yesterday)

Triglycerides from 161 to 87

we're not going to talk about the rest of the cholesterol yet 🤣 Retesting that in 6 months...

and for the first time in my adult life, even on 5,000 IU daily for at least 10 years, my Vitamin D is smack dab in the middle of the normal range rather than slightly under the lowest of normal.

My BP isn't coming down, which is curious with this loss, so she switched my meds. I could not exercise until recently because 5mg kicked my butt energy-wise. I hope that now that my energy has returned, Peloton and Bodypump will get the BP and cholesterol to start creeping down.

My doc put in an order for 7.5 mg, so there's time to get it when I'm ready to start it in two weeks. Today, CVS said they ordered it and were hopeful it would be in tomorrow but that it has taken longer than usual to get that dose. So we'll see. I've got time, and they can't even run it to my insurance until Saturday anyway, so hopefully, it will be resolved by the time I need it. And if not, I can always stay on 5mg for another month. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I'm over the moon at the results I'm seeing!

I am however going to Vegas next week so I’m waiting until next Friday to start my 10. Hang in there!! I’m hoping 10 will be my sweet spot but it may just take you longer to find your right dosage!

It's different for each person and it will take time.  It was like that for me for the 2nd month, then it kicked into overdrive.  Things that helped me was eating more vegetables and proteins and walking for 30mins.

Keep it up and stick with it!

At first, I thought I should be feeling the nausea/headache/etc to see results (5+ lbs/week) but instead I’ve gone slow and have been leaning into changing what I eat in a very sustainable way. I’ve deleted the food delivery apps and cook for pleasure. I talk to my psychologist about emotional eating. I feel like MJ is helping me fix my life.

## Comment 
> I went shopping for clothes today for the first time since starting Mounjaro. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I started early August and have lost about 48 lbs. Anyway, for the first time in over 12 years I was able to shop for some of my clothes in the “regular” sizes. It felt weird and I kept expecting people to judge me for being “too big” to be shopping in that area but it was exhilarating. I still have over 50 lbs to go but I’m going to take this win. I am so grateful for this medication.

## Comment 
> I’m not OP. But I too switched from Ozempic to MJ in September. MJ is so much better in so many ways. I would get stomach pains with OZ and it lost effectiveness quickly for me. With MJ I’ve only had injection site itchiness for a few days and supreme appetite suppression and weightloss never felt better in my life I’m down 48 pounds so far. Highly recommend. MJ has superior appetite suppression IMHO.

>  I actually didn’t have to plead my case at all. The conversation essentially went like this:
“I was taking Mounjaro for weight loss and getting my script online, but I’d feel more comfortable getting it here. It’s covered by my insurance with an approved PA.”
“Okay, when was your last injection?”
“Two weeks ago.”
*asks about my dosage and explains about needing to titrate back up*
“Have you been able to lose weight so far?”
“Yes, I’ve lost 20 pounds” 
“That’s great. I’ll send this to your pharmacy and get the PA done. I’d like you to come back in three months. Merry Christmas!”

They are based in the small town I grew up in, so I wasn’t sure if they would be super familiar with it. She said they don’t prescribe it often, but she knew what it was to be able to talk about the doses, side effects, and the shortage of weight loss medications right now. Maybe that is a good sign that more doctors and nurse practitioners are hearing about how well it is working for some!

It was raining a lot here and I slowed down majorly on the brisk walking ( I was up to 45min a day) and I had a 2 week plateau. I started walking a lot again and lost 5 lbs in like 3 days. It was crazy. I’m on my second month of 5 mg and I’m not impressed with it either but the 7.5 if on back order so I’m waiting till that comes in. Keep up the consistency, and adjust a little as you plateau. Good luck, you can do it! :)

## Comment 
> Hi y'all! I am just ending my third month at 5mg. I am down \~25 lbs and pretty much all of the gastrointestinal side effects are gone. I can eat almost anything I want as long as I eat reasonable portions. There are certain foods that I really just can't eat anymore, and I'm ok with that. Sweets are pretty much a no-go except for tiny tastes. The weird one for me, though, is Fritos corn chips! I can eat a few Doritos, Cheetos, pretty much anything else and I'm fine. But even one or two Fritos has my stomach hurting for two days! I wonder what the ingredient is that is sitting poorly. One way or the other, it's a small price to pay. I am T2D and I got my most recent lab results today...my A1C is down to 5.7! It hasn't been that low since my diagnosis over 15 years ago! My insulin intake is down from 250+ units a day to about 75 units a day. My fasting blood sugar is down from 200+ every day to around 80. I cannot express enough how grateful I am for this miraculous medication. The weight loss is a fantastic side effect, but the improvement in my diabetes control and the resulting improvement in my quality of life and life expectancy are priceless.

## Comment 
> Perhaps your dose is too high.  I eat three meals a day and have lost over 50 pounds (over 20% of starting weight) since August on 5 Mg the whole time.  I don’t believe the main mechanism for the weight loss is supposed to be nausea or induced satiety.  I haven’t been nauseous since the first couple of weeks.  If you’re just starting out, it’ll get better very soon and you should definitely still be eating. Just eat sensibly, mostly low carb, etc.

## Comment 
> Love to share— 40M, HW: 252, SW: 248, SA1C: 7.8, CA1C: 5.6 

Was diagnosed T2D in August with an A1C of 7.8.  Always had high fasting blood glucose readings from annual office health/wellness screenings but it never triggered any intervention.  Was probably living with diabetes for awhile and didn’t even know it.  (Looking back I was quite sick, just never to the point of going to the ER.) 

My PCP put me on 500 Mg of Metformin and 2.5 Mg of Mounjaro increased to 5 Mg after the first month and that’s where I’ve been since.   

I completely changed my diet.  Cutting out fast food, anything with added sugar (especially coffee), stopped drinking soda or sweet drinks (including diet drinks) and began drinking tons of water.  For dinner my wife and i switched to Hello Fresh meal kits five nights a week which has helped with both portion control and calorie counting.  I’m the chef in the house so this has helped me continue to cook. I used to get cravings to order ethnic food like Mexican or Indian, now I know I have those things in the fridge.    (DM me if you want a free box.) 

Additionally I started cycling everyday at least 30 minutes.   I already enjoyed cycling and had a Peloton, but pre Mounjaro I could never get below 220.   I also let the stress of work get in the way of exercise previously.  No longer— as soon as I wake up I exercise before answering work emails, etc.  A major part of my journey is realizing that I have to prioritize my health and family first.   

In October I started doing resistance training for the first time ever using my local YMCA’s EGYM machines.  After putting my daughters to bed I’ll zip over to our Y for two sets each on all 11 machines typically three to five times a week.   I’ve put on muscle so my fat loss is more than the 50 pounds I’ve lost over all.  I have more energy now than I can remember ever having.  I can’t even remember when the last time I was under 200 pounds and I’ve probably never been this strong.  (I’m a Data Scientist by trade, so you imagine I’m a bit on the nerdy side, was never an athlete.)

I check my blood sugar at least twice a day and it’s been excellent. 

As you can see I’ve put a lot of work into this— but Mounjaro has made all the difference.  It’s allowed diet and exercise to actually work on me like it might for a completely healthy person.   It’s allowed me to drive past a McDonald’s and not look back.  For the first time ever I think I can actually get down to a health weight.  

Good luck on your journey and let me know if you have any questions.

I did 4 weeks of 2.5mg and just took my second of 5mg yesterday. So far it looks like I have lost about 5 pounds. Tough to tell when I regularly vary that much over a month anyway. Starting weight was 253, was diagnosed T2 a little over 2 years ago.

So hang in there. Taking weight off slowly can also make it easier to keep it off in the long run.

> I’ve been on Mounjaro for 6 weeks now! I’ve lost 1lb. Honestly don’t feel much different aside from appetite suppression, I kind of hate that I can’t eat a healthy amount of daily food. I’ve considered jumping off it. It just doesn’t seem sustainable and I know if I continue workouts, there’s a better chance of healthy results for me.

My starting weight on 09/20/22 was 232.2. It's now 12/20/22, and I'm 226.2. so that's only a loss of 6 pounds over 12 weeks. I was one week on Mounjaro 2.5, 4 weeks on 5, 4 weeks on 7.5, now 3 weeks on 10. I've had zero appetite suppression, except for a few hours here and there.

Technically that's 0.5 pounds a week loss, but the way it really happened was that I lost no weight the first 7 weeks. I was still 232.8 on 11/11, then went down to 227 by 11/21. Back up to 234.4 on 11/27 and down to 224 by  12/11,  now up to 226.2. I have such natural water weight fluctuation that it feels like I've lost no weight at all yet. But I'm hopeful for going up to the 12.5.

I was worried about side effects, so was injecting in my thigh until 11/11, when I switched to stomach. 

Side effects I *have* definitely experienced: excess (and extra forceful) burping and flatulence. Once I got really nauseous and threw up, but maybe that was an illness. I've had increased constipation.

Background:
I am diagnosed Type 2 diabetes (since June 2021, diagnosed prediabetic for 22 years prior), PCOS since 2002, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, ADHD, PTSD, narrowed esophagus, and obesity, of course. I haven't been diagnosed with binge eating disorder, but from all the things I've seen on here, I'm fairly certain I've had that my whole life. Been on metformin for 22 years for PCOS &amp; prediabetes. I was started on Victoza for diabetes in June 2021, I started at 252 at that time, was down to 232 by September 2022. I am 46, f, Native American (Ojibwe) &amp; European (German) background. My A1C dropped from over 10 to 6.1 on the Victoza - my provider at IHS said they've noticed greater and faster efficacy of the GLP medications with the Native populations.

## Comment 
> I have to say I am down a total of 14 pounds. To be able to be below 190 is pretty cool.  (at 186) Side effects pretty much just low level nausea which is just keeping me from eating. if i didnt have the MJ pens and I was compounding, I would definitely be splitting up the dose to twice a week. I can definitely feel the MJ wear off towards the end of the week.

On the very positive side, I lost 3.1 pounds my first full week.

## Comment 
>  I’ve been asking this the whole last week. 😆. I’m saying yes. But people have told me to try and drink more water, go to the bathroom (I’m constipated so bad), give it time, etc. 

And then a few people said that this medicine was made to work in a way where you titrate up. Why am I not following the directions..and they are right. For some reason, we all try not to have to increase our dosage, but I’m not sure why. I was in that same boat. Today I am going to go up after being on five for nine full weeks. In the last two weeks, I have gained 4 pounds. So for me, I definitely believe it is time to move up. I lost 20 total at one point but now 16.

Also, my weight journey is not progressing like people I see posting on here. I went from 328 lbs - 315 lbs in 8 weeks, some people get that is one week.  Hope!

Besides figuring out some digestive issues (diarrhea on 2.5 and constipation on 5), overall things are great. Idc if I have to be on this medication forever.

## Comment 
> I’m not OP. But I too switched from Ozempic to MJ in September. MJ is so much better in so many ways. I would get stomach pains with OZ and it lost effectiveness quickly for me. With MJ I’ve only had injection site itchiness for a few days and supreme appetite suppression and weightloss never felt better in my life I’m down 48 pounds so far. Highly recommend. MJ has superior appetite suppression IMHO.

## Comment 
> I wonder if the people who lose weight so effectively with Mounjaro, whatever their weight gain problem is, it’s very much tied to GLP-1 and GIP imbalances? I was on Ozempic for 12 weeks and didn’t lose weight and have been on Mounjaro for 4 weeks and lost 4 pounds. So I feel like maybe I have a GIP imbalance.

## Comment 
> My GP prescribed Mounjaro for me in July. I’m a T2 diabetic, and my A1C was 7.6. I was on 2.5 until September, got my A1C down to 6.2, but only lost a pound. She moved me to 5 in September. I’m down 10 lbs, but at 5’3” and 190, I have a long way to go. 

Yesterday, I had an appointment for a re-check. My A1C is now 5.3. Based on my A1C and my weight loss so far, she doesn’t want to move me up beyond 5. I’m also still on Metformin. 

I need a reality check, honestly. Does this sound reasonable? I am so used to people losing 25 lbs in a month and doctors moving people up doses quickly that I’m feeling frustrated - both with her conservative approach and with my slow weight loss.  I think my perspective is a little skewed. What do y’all think?

## Comment 
> Ok so, I've had 2 injections of the 5mg. I've not had any changes yet. I'm assuming it's still just getting in my system, but I'm constantly hungry. More hungry than I was before starting Mounjaro. Is this normal? My endo put me on it for hunger and weight loss plus T2D and it seems like I never stop eating. I haven't went back to the gym just yet. Got another 2 weeks. Jan 2nd I go back. I've got wrist tendonitis and trying to give it plenty rest after steroid shots just before Thanksgiving. They are still sore and certain movements are very painful, so I am waiting until Jan 2nd. Then, back in the gym Mon-Sat. I'm hoping I start to lose weight at that point, as of yet have gained about 4-5 lbs.

I don't expect it to work instantly or be Grand weight loss, but it's just weird to me that I'm hungrier and gained weight for 6 weeks. I'm trying to get my meals healthier. I'm just struggling. I wish I could lose weight eating what I want to eat. I hate cooking. Meal prep is fine, I've done it, but I tend to ignore what I've premade and do other stuff. Then, I eat mostly the same foods over and over. So it's quite boring.

Would going on keto or low carb help? I'm trying to do 50g of carbs per meal as that's what my Endo told me to do. I suck at it. It just sucks cuz I'm constantly hungry. I'm hoping this goes away soon.

## Comment 
> Congratulations! I had already lost 90 pounds before starting Mounjaro. It took me almost 6 years. I have been stuck at minus 90, though, for 9 months. I have been on Mounjaro for 5 weeks and just went up to 5 mg. I have already lost 12 pounds! I had a lot of diarrhea and a nasty taste in my mouth for 3 weeks, but I am glad that I waited it out. I found that the Olly bloating supplement gets rid of the worst of the side effects. My fasting blood glucose has actually gone below 140! I was having problems with it hitting as high as 225. I also only get up to urinate 2 to 3 times a night instead of almost hourly. It is definitely getting my diabetes under control.

My biggest struggle is drinking enough fluids. I've got to force myself to drink any fluids. I am also doing low carb (maybe 10g aday).

## Comment 
> When I started in October Mounjaro was readily available. I just finished my second box and should have taken an injection this past Sunday. I can’t find mounjaro anywhere. I also can’t find Ozempic or Saxenda. They are all completely out of stock. I have 100+ lbs to lose and so far have lost 30lbs.

But, it’s not just the weight I am concerned about. This medicine just makes me feel ‘normal’. No intrusive thoughts, my anxiety has been virtually gone and today it’s back with vengeance. 

If you’re like me and mounjaro isn’t available, what are your replacing it with?

How is your A1C? Glucose? Have you been able to cut back on other medications?

Are you doing anything else to lose weight? Daily morning weigh ins? Exercise? Calorie counting? With the holiday season, could you be overeating?

I started at 195.5 with Mounjaro and am now at 187.3, so 8.2 pounds over 7 weeks. It's not amazing compared to others, but I know that this is good, steady weight loss. My weightlifting gains are also something to be proud of! My nonfasting glucose was also healthy the other day during bloodwork.

Always the hottest one in the room, couldn’t eat or drink anything warm when out with others, and even a little bit of stress would put me over the top and I’d sweat.  My family would complain how cold it was dressed in sweaters, and I was in a t-shirt feeling fine.  

Now I’m on mounjaro (2.5 before and 5 now), and I’m the cold one!  I don’t sweat anymore unless exercising when I am supposed to!  I am down about 15% of my body now but even in the beginning, it seemed to make a big difference.  

My ongoing (non medical) theory is:  since it does generate heat to digest food - maybe I was a like a heater with all the food I was digesting.  Without as much food to stoke the fire - maybe we’re cooler with mounjaro?

Started Mounjaro in early October. Prescribed for type 2 diabetes. Down 40 pounds. A1C went from 11 to 4.8. Doing hot yoga two or three times a week. Not really watching what I eat so much as eating much less of the foods I enjoy. Taking two weeks off to be able to enjoy all the delicious food on my vacation! Happy Holidays everyone!

I don’t see anything wrong with eating a healthy portion for meals and snacking regularly assuming that it’s just hunger for snacks that can be satisfied with things that contain protein or are high fiber.  My go to snacks are lightly salted mixed nuts, tuna fish, apples or avocados depending on the time of day.  I’m T2D so making sure I don’t go low is important too.  

I still don’t have the cravings for fast food like I used to.  Before Mounjaro I couldn’t drive past a McDonald’s alone without stopping.  Now I can treat my daughter to a happy meal and not order a meal for myself.  That’s truly amazing!

My starting BMI was 50.6 and is now 39.7! My A1c is now prediabetes levels as well. I haven't checked it in 2 months, but my last A1c was 5.8. I'm very thrilled and thankful.

> It should be a decision you and your doctor make together based on all available data.   

I’m T2D so for my doctor and I it’s about my blood glucose and A1C.  My fasting numbers are between 70 and 110 every morning, averaging around 94. My A1c dropped from 7.8 in August to 5.6 in November.  (Note that I’m also on 500 Mg of Metformin.)  Since my numbers are so good my doctor doesn’t think increasing from 5 Mg makes sense and is worried that an increase in dosage might even cause me to go low.   (The clinical trials didn’t have any hypo events, but my doctor thinks that more data is needed to definitively state that it’s “impossible to have a hypo event on MJ.”)

I no longer have the type of appetite suppression that is often lauded on here and eat three healthy low carb (but not zero carb or keto) meals a day plus healthy snacks.   Despite this I’m down over 22% of my body weight and have “slowed down” to losing a pound or two a week now.   Went from class 2 obesity to simply overweight, my current BMI is between 28 and 29.  I have tons of energy, no ill side effects and feel like I’m just a generally healthy and happy person now.  

It might take me six more months to go from overweight to healthy weight, but I’m OK with that.  The goal is reachable, and that’s something that I could never say before.

> I felt the same as you until….I didn’t. Literally one day it just stopped working. I was hungry all the time, craving foods, drinking a a lot more, no more weight loss for two weeks- gained a little. So I went up and have been on 5 for 9 weeks now and I’m having the same problem. Gained 2 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Can’t stop munching. Etc. I will finish the 3 5’s I have left in the box and then happily step up to 7.5. 
It’s great until it isn’t. 🤷🏼‍♀️

With MJ I’ve only had injection site itchiness for a few days and supreme appetite suppression and weightloss never felt better in my life I’m down 48 pounds so far. Highly recommend. MJ has superior appetite suppression IMHO.

OW:235 lbs CW: 185 GW: 160 (55+)

I have been on Victoza for a year. Like others, I came to a plateau that did not go away. I also could never get past the 1.2 mg dose because of side effects. And it was hard to go anywhere. The number of times I have had to turn around and go get my medication...

My insulin levels are within normal limits (barely) since 2005. I am hovering at 30 BMI. And I need to lose more weight before my surgery in the spring.

Side effects (nausea, constipation) have been unrelenting on Victoza. My GI system has been seriously abused in my lifetime (genetics, surgeries, chronic nausea since 7 yo). It has been especially a struggle in the last few years. Luckily, I am a nurse so I have serious skills in managing constipation. Thank goodness, or I would not have lost the weight!

Today, I start Mounjaro, and I am nervous. I am hoping I can manage the side effects. I just want it to be a little easier than Victoza. (Please) I know a lot of the reported side effects are the same, but if it is even 15% better, it will be a miracle.

As many of you have probably experienced, losing weight was an exercise in futility. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes, insulin resistance (genetic), hypothyroidism (25+ yrs), increased cholesterol. I didn't have a high calorie diet (1500 kcal). Add in a little menopause, and you're pretty much screwed.  If I lost one pound in 2 months, I was gloriously happy. Until I nothing lost in the next 3 months.

Victoza has been an absolute miracle medication. My father and all 5 of his siblings were diabetic, including 2 on insulin pumps. I wonder if they would still be alive if they had Victoza or Mounjaro. I have been actively treating my diabetes since I was 40.

Wish me good luck! Hopefully, the side effects will be manageable. I will even go for possibly not having nausea for a day or two.

This medication has changed me in so many ways - the food noise and constant thoughts about eating are gone.  It’s like I had a faulty wire sending signals to my brain that kept triggering me to eat and MJ disconnected the wire.

I’m 3 months in and down 30 pounds and I will stay on this as long as I can until I’m healthy and stable.  Best of luck to you.

I lost nothing in December. My weight fluctuated from 219 to 228 all month. I was terribly bloated too. Took my shot last week and weighed in yesterday morning at 217. The bloat is gone and I can see a difference already. I don’t know why I had a weird month but I’m happily losing again. I’d just try to use up what you have on hand before spending the money on a new prescription since 7.5 is so hard to get now.

## Comment 
>  I’ve been asking this the whole last week. 😆. I’m saying yes. But people have told me to try and drink more water, go to the bathroom (I’m constipated so bad), give it time, etc. 

And then a few people said that this medicine was made to work in a way where you titrate up. Why am I not following the directions..and they are right. For some reason, we all try not to have to increase our dosage, but I’m not sure why. I was in that same boat. Today I am going to go up after being on five for nine full weeks. In the last two weeks, I have gained 4 pounds. So for me, I definitely believe it is time to move up. I lost 20 total at one point but now 16.

I did lose some weight on it but this week I have been eating and drinking a lot. Normally I can walk away from food but this week I just couldn’t. And have gained 2 pounds. Ugh. 
Just venting. Can’t go up on dose yet since I have couple boxes of 5 to finish. Anyone else in same boat? We can vent together.

> Me!!!!!   I couldn't fill before I left for Christmas and was without a scale (that I need to keep me honest) and no MJ.  Traveling has always wreaked havoc on my weight in the past.   I have had such great luck with my pharmacy I was too scared to try and move my prescription to one where I was traveling to.    I gained 4lbs in just over a week, which is hard since I have been a slow and steady looser at 1lb a week average.   It makes me frightened for when I may not be able to take this.

I honestly wasn’t expecting Calibrate to do much but was going to ask my PCP to see if she would do it since she approved what Calibrate’s original plan was. Who knows. Im on week two of the compounded semaglutide and they started me out on a really low dosage and I’ve gained 5lbs eating what I was eating on Mounjaro but abstaining even though the hunger is back in full force.

## Comment 
> How have you all been doing through this food-celebration-heavy time of year?

I decided a few years ago not to stress over eating around the holidays but also remember that I can eat any of the food available any other time of year, if I truly want to. That really helped me avoid overeating calorie-dense and lower nutrition options without feeling as deprived. I took that tactic again this year and decided also not to weight myself until today so that I wouldn't get too upset if the scale went up. I ended up losing almost 3lbs over the last 2 weeks! I was surprised. 

It was definitely easier for me to eat fewer sweets, I found that I could have one cookie and enjoy it and didn't feel the constant urge to return to the cookie plate. I've been on Wegovy and now Mounjaro for almost the whole year and I still can't get over how much has changed in my brain when it comes to sugary foods. 

I still had some family specialties (feast of the seven fishes, anyone?) but everything in moderation, never felt overstuffed, never felt guilty or uncomfortable. It's honestly been an amazing experience.

And not only hungry but food sounds good. I even made it to 1,500 calories multiple times this week as the week went on!

## Comment 
> Okay so I figured I would post my experience because when I switched to ozempic I couldn’t find much information or reviews so maybe this will help someone. A little context I am from Canada , 34 &amp; female and type 2 diabetic - I switched from trulicity to ozempic about 6 weeks ago ( my insurance would only cover trulicity 60%  but told me they would cover ozempic 100% ) I was a little nervous because I get good numbers with trulicity and I really wanted Ozempic to work because I  like the once a week shot instead of the daily shots I was doing with Lantus.

Okay so because I was switching my doctor and pharmacist agreed I would be okay to start at the  1mg - I was nervous about that cause I remember starting trulicity and the beginning was horrible - nausea , acid reflux was really bad ( I use to call it acid reflux Sunday ) , I was sensitive to smell lol I still can’t eat certain things cause the smells trigger me now lol .. that all being said .. I started Ozempic on the Sunday - no negative side effects. I was 186 when I started Ozempic  ( Sidenote: end of 2019 into the  beginning of 2020 I had lost 20 lbs and gained most of it back during lockdown)  I weighed my self today and I am 164lbs ..I personally didn’t really notice the weight loss until I tried on a shirt that fit tighter before and was a loose today which sent me down a rabbit hole of trying on clothes.  Ozempic has definitely curved my appetite - sometimes I honestly could go without eating , I have a coffee with a premier protein shake from Costco in the AM ( normally around 9am) and don’t eat until around 5-6 not on purpose I just literally don’t feel hungry at all which is a different for me because since the pandemic started I feel like I was eating so much outta boredom.  I also was really bad for snacking late at night , I feel full faster now and sometimes do feel a little nauseated when I eat past my fullness which also making me eat less cause I don’t want to get sick and I do partake in 🍃 💨 on a daily basis and find I don’t even get the munchies anymore. Which is also kinda nice. I do gotta keep on top of my blood sugars more often so I do not goto low but I usually can tell when I’m low so I gotta force myself to eat something. I do feel like I have more energy now and that’s even with less eating during the day. I am going to start working out so I’m hoping that will help with continuing the weight loss journey. My numbers are about the same as they were on trulicity. I have drank alcohol since I’ve started Ozempic and I haven’t had any sickness from that ( but again I couldn’t tell .. age has made recovering from a night of drinks harder , just can’t bounce back the same as I could in my twenties). I have enjoyed my Ozempic experience. If anyone has questions feel free to comment and I will try to answer. This was just a little snippet of my experience and hoping that it will help someone that is starting or looking to start. ♥️

> I just have to share my news with this group because you understand the ups and downs of this journey. I saw my endocrinologist on Wednesday and she had labs done and told me to expect the results by next week. I had an A1C of 12.4 on 4/27 and fasting blood glucose was 441. I saw the endocrinologist on 5/12. I was already on Metformin and Januvia but she stopped Januvia and replaced it with Jardiance. She also prescribed Toujeo up to 45 units each evening. I saw her again on 6/3 when she added Ozempic.  I have made drastic changes to my diet and have lost about 20 lbs. But I wasn’t expecting the news I just got - my A1C is 6.1!!! I was expecting it to maybe have gone down to 8 or 9 but this is just such amazing news!! Thanks to all of you for sharing your knowledge and experiences!

The thing I am having a problem with is adjusting how much food to cook/how much to buy each week. Every week I buy too much food, throw it away and feel terrible. Have any of you cut down from cooking like you have a family of 10 down to a family of 2?

## Comment 
> As of this morning, I've lost 50 pounds!  

I started on June 7, so I’m getting close to finishing my 5th month.   I’m a 5'11” woman in my late 50's.   My weight has been sneaking up since menopause and then I lost a parent in a particularly hard way and slipped in my habits.  Along comes the pandemic, with stress eating and not getting out to exercise and no walking for my commute anymore.   I ballooned up to my highest weight ever, 325.   

I learned that I am a type 2 diabetic on June 7 (not a surprise, my Dad was diagnosed about the same age and then there's the bad habits and all).  I started Ozempic that day.  

Things I’ve learned:

- Ozempic is not a magic elixir that makes weight disappear with no effort on your part.  It IS a huge leg up toward losing weight and getting your sugar under control.  You have to work, though.  Change your habits and eat healthy.  

- Ozempic helps to limit the amount of food you can eat.  For me, it also changed the kind of foods I could eat.   Most starches in any significant quantity gross me out so I’m not eating them, which is great both for weight loss and my blood sugar.   We bought candy for the trick 

- Your body clears food through your stomach more slowly on this medicine.  That means you have to change how/when you eat and sometimes what you eat.   Foods that normally are a little gassy for me like hummus…I can’t eat those anymore.  It sits in my stomach and I burp and burp and burp.   Bend over to pick something up….big old burp.   Tie my shoes…big old burp.  As much as I love some of those foods, it’s not worth it.   

- I have to consciously work to avoid constipation.   Your digestive system needs some fiber to push on through.   I have to pick fruits and veggies with a bit of bulk to them.   I also have to eat some fiber cereal.  That’s a challenge for two reasons.   1. Carbs look pretty gross to me right now.   2. You tend to eat cold breakfast cereals before they’ve gone soggy.  That means while that cereal is sitting in your stomach, it’s absorbing liquid and swelling.    I was feeling good one morning and ate a normal sized bowl of muesli for breakfast.   All day I got increasingly uncomfortable until in the afternoon when that muesli erupted from me like Mount Vesuvius.    Lesson learned.  I now make a bowl where there is much more milk than cereal and I let it go mushy.    Works great.   

- I’ve had alcohol three times since I’ve been on this.   The first time, I didn’t get significantly drunk but my guard slipped a bit and I ate more than I should have out at a restaurant.   Got home, felt terrible and ended up throwing up during the night, which honestly was a relief.  My other two occasions were both special dinners out.    In each case, I had one glass of wine to be social and very very slowly sipped it through the whole meal.  Worked fine.  

- You need to move.   Part of my feeling healthier is that I’m now walking again and have even started riding an exercise bike and the gym and occasionally the elliptical.      When I feel healthier, it’s easier to make the right food choices.     

I’ve worked really hard at this, learning what I can and can’t do.    Partially this is because I’m unhappy being so much overweight but I also really want to avoid having to go to daily blood sugar monitoring.   I’m proving that I can keep my sugar under control.    In terms of weight, I’d love to lose another 50 lbs, which would put me still above my weight in high school but I think I might be able to maintain i.

I have been puking and had explosive bowels since I started, horrible acid reflux, sometimes can’t eat. But I’ve lost 30lbs when not even eating right and exercise was working.

I would love with these symptoms the rest of my life if it mean I got healthy and lost the weight I needed to.

What’s the other side of this?

I am not worried about losing a lot of weight quickly... i would rather tone up as I let go of the weight I no longer need!    But, I find myself weaker and more easily exhausted than ever before... and less interested in working out.  Anyone else experiencing this side effect?

## Comment 
> Hello I’ve been on Ozempic for approximately 10 weeks now. With a 13 pound weightloss. 
This was my 2nd 1 mg dose last Sunday. 
Monday I was terribly bloated and burping what tasted like throw up. 
(Sorry If TMI)
Still not feeling good today. 
Same symptoms. 
I see people say that have sulfur burps. Idk if this is the same. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated. 
Also has anyone else experienced this? 
Otherwise NO side effects. (Besides constipation 😬)
Just curious if this is a stomach bug or Ozempic. 
Thanks to all!

I'm up 6 lbs already.  I also feel bloated. My Dr was surprised I moved up to 1mg and thought everyone stayed at .5mg. My new script is for 1mg so I don't want to increase my dose otherwise I'll run out before my next appt.

## Comment 
> So far I've lost about 4 pounds and my glucose has been going down steadily and it been about 3 days now. Stupid question but do you not get the urge to eat and it feels like I'm losing weight or am I crazy. I used to have bad sugar cravings but they don't really happen anymore.

I’m not interested in keto but looking would love to hear your experiences!

## Comment 
> I (45f) started Ozempic on Nov 15th and did 2 weeks of .25mg and another 2 weeks of .5mg. I’ve been on 1.0 for four weeks and have lost almost 15 lbs. I weighed 199-200 when I started and weighed 185 today. I haven’t changed my diet or exercised more (other than walking a lot while I was in Vegas). I didn’t get nauseous really, other than a couple of times, and it was mild. My blood sugar has never been better. I go for my A1C checkup in March and I’m confident my doc will remove me from metformin and take back my type 2 diabetes diagnosis. I have been an on and off diabetic for 13 years. Thankfully my doctor gave me 3 months of Ozempic samples, so I am saving $250 a month (at least). My insurance doesn’t cover it. Thankful for this journey!

## Comment 
> Title explains it all I guess. These side effects are ruining my life. I only took my first dose a few days ago, but if they don't calm down soon, this is 100% not worth it for me. I can't keep anything down, I'm constantly nauseous, I'm constantly either too cold or too hot, constant dizziness, slight breathing difficulties, headaches... The list goes on. And yes I've been tested for covid and it's not that.
I'm going to have my second dose when it's been a week since my first one, but if I keep having these side effects I won't be able to continue. I've lost 2kg in the last 4 days simply from not being able to keep anything down. I feel awful. 🤮

I’m doing Noom which has given me 1300 calories per day and am doing weight training twice a week for 45 minutes. I want to lose another 15 lbs  at least to get under the bmi for obesity. 

Is 1300 calories about right or is it less? I want to be able to lose the weight and keep it off. Would love some opinions…

I began to feel defeated and that the medicine was no longer working for me. Yesterday I did a 30 min spin class then had a cookie, 2 chicken wings and a big scoop of baked mac and cheese for dinner. This morning the scale said 221!!!

## Comment 
> Hello Ozempic fam, as of last Monday I took my final shot. I started on November 29th 2021, and have lost 39lbs in ~2 1/2 months. 238 to 199 this morning. I started at .25 and worked my way up to 1mg. The drug side effects during the acclimation process were sulfurous burping, vomit burps, upset stomach, and loose bowels. Outside of the sulfurous burps, most of those things went away.  

My doctor recommended that I move to Metformin to continue lowering my A1C. My fasting blood tests revealed that I’m .1 away from a high normal reading. Considering where I started, this is great news. 

The game-plan from here on out is to control sugar/weight through diet and exercise. With some luck I’ll be off of Metformin before long. I’m still battling some blood pressure issues but I’m hoping that will resolve when I arrive at my optimal weight (19lbs to go!). 

I just wanted to report in that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that if I can do this, you can too. 

Take care everybody. Feel better, believe in yourself and keep on keeping on.

How much weight have you lost at this dose? Are there any side effects I should look out for? 

Thanks all!

## Comment 
> Hi all. I've been on ozempic since November 2020. I have had success. I lost about 30 pounds. I live in Ontario, Canada and the gyms just opened up again 2.5 weeks ago. I started weight lifting again and since then I have not lost any more weight at all. I'm so confused. I thought this would help my weight loss.
Also I'm on 1mg. That's the max dose for weight loss in Ontario, Canada.
I felt that ozempic worked better on the lower doses. Is that normal?
Thanks for your help!

## Comment 
> I am on my 11th week of treatment and on my 2nd 1mg dose.

I seemed to lose weight at first, went from 221 lbs down to 213 lbs (I am 36 years old, 5’0” tall, etc), but I just gained most of it back (back at 220 lbs). My clothes are still much looser in fit than when I first started the injections last December. I haven’t been eating more. I feel like this might be water weight from menstruating so I will weigh again in about a week. I also gained the weight back the last time I was on my period but then started to lose again after my period finished.

The only changes I made was that I increased the amount of exercise and intensity. I was originally walking 3 times a week and now I am running 5 miles on Saturday and Sunday and running 1 mile each evening Monday-Friday because I am training for an 8K race. I am not new to running, I ran for about 3 years before the pandemic. I also lift, but exercise never had any impact on my weight which is why I tried ozempic.

The only thing that helped me to lose weight in the past was keto, but I developed an eating disorder (I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder because of my weight but I feel like I fit more into the anorexia or bulimia because of my extreme tendencies to restrict although I have not purged since I was a teen) and type 2 diabetes because of keto. All the medical professionals I work with and the dietitian do not want me to restrict carbs anymore.

I use a portion plate and eat the amount of veggies, proteins, and carbs.  

Because of my restriction tendencies, I am not allowed to weigh food or count calories, but based on photos of meals I have shown to professionals, I average about 1800-2200 calories a day. So I know I am eating a reasonable amount.

Since I am not losing, and cutting calories is not an option since my brain will sometimes trick me into only eating 700-800 calories a day (which is what happened all the time when I was on keto), is there anything I should ask my bariatric provider? I believe the next step could be to see an endocrinologist. If that’s the next step, what can I expect when I see the endocrinologist? Any questions I should ask them?

How much time did it take with being on ozempic before you started to see progress?

I have been hovering at 325lbs for the past year and a half. I have had my hunger decrease with ozempic and I am eating way less and exercising so I just don't get it. My doc wants me to go to 1.5mg if the weight still doesn't move but I already hate injecting myself so having to do it twice I want to avoid. Anyone else not losing weight? Advice?

I'm obese. 160cm, 117kg.

I've been on metformin for a few months and lost 4ish KG, I was 121kg. 

Doc has mentioned ozempic and after a google search I found lots of scary things on it.. I have severe health anxiety and panic attacks and general anxiety..so I'm terrified to take it even though I know it's probably for the best..
I do want to take it I'm just scared of the side effects. 

What exactly does it do? Does it reduce your appetite? 
I'm on metformin and have a very low appetite as it is so I'm worried I have no appetite and can't eat and become sick from not able to eat.. anxiety is a vicious cycle lol.

Idk what the point of this post is I guess I just want everyone's input.
Are the side effects as bad as they say? Will it get rid of my appetite fully?! I will bring all my concerns up with my doc at my next appointment but thought it would be better to ask people who have actually used it

Edit to ask: also is it for life? If not, what happens when you get off it? Will you gain all the weight back? 

So sorry for my rambling..

I'm a 40something year old woman. Does anyone have insight into these numbers? You all seem to have a lot more scientific knowledge than me.

## Comment 
> I recently began Ozempic. This is paired with 1000 mg extended release Metformin. Although it’s only my second week, I feel like there has been a difference in my appetite and overall, how I feel. I’ve lost around 1-2 pounds. The unfortunate circumstance is that my insurance will not pay for it so if I want to continue, I’m faced with that $800 monthly bill. I’m thinking of sucking it up and forking out the money for another month or two (2-3 months total), but I’m wondering if that is long enough to see the results I want. I know everyone is different but I’m hoping to get around 30 pounds off as a kickstart to my body. Curious how your weight loss went and the duration of such.

## Comment 
> What is up, my dudes. I’m here to ask everyone else who is further along in their journey about their food choices and how it’s affected their side effects. NSFW because poop talk. So far, I’m 2 1/2 weeks in and have lost about 9 lbs which is absolutely insane to me! I noticed my main side effect issues are some pretty intense diarrhea (worse than metformin was) and almost constant nausea. Finally I put it together in my head that really fatty or carb heavy meals cause an almost instant reaction that has me running to the bathroom.

For reference, my days are usually plain Greek yogurt with berries for breakfast, a salad at lunchtime and some combo of 1/4 lean protein/1/4 complex carb/1/2 veggies on the plate at dinner. Some extra fruit in there if I get hungry in between. If I deviate from this at all, sickness. Normal, or no? Will it be like this for as long as I’m on, or do the side effects chill out a little? Also, I’m aware that it might not be the same for everyone. Just looking for some hope!

I started Ozempic in October at .25mg and went up to .5mg after 4 weeks. I had great appetite control at first and I've lost 20 pounds but that side effect wore off after a few months. 

He did increase my dose to 1mg to see if I can get the weight loss benefit back and get my A1C down some more.  I took the 1mg dose yesterday and so far I still don't have that ""already full"" feeling I had on it the first several weeks. 

I'm still glad it's working for my A1C, though!

I’m a 58-year-old female, type 2 diabetic and about 120 pounds overweight. I was very hesitant about taking my first shot last Sunday night. I thought I would take the shot and immediately start projectile vomiting. I only got a little nauseated my first breakfast and maybe a little bit for a few days but that resolved when I learned how much I could eat to get the sensation of being full.  Ginger chews have been my lifesaver.  I had a hard time getting in 1700 calories. I averaged around 1000 a day. Not being focused on food was wonderful. I also thought I would be eating a weird diet and eating things I don’t like. I found that I am actually eating better now. I’ve found some low-calorie recipes that I love on YouTube. There are a lot of great videos for encouragement and recipes. My particular favorite is Mindy Pedersen. The first time I watched her I thought, there is no way she is losing weight eating like this. She’s lost over 60 pounds on Wegovy which is the same thing as Ozempic. Her recipes are wonderful. Made the Dollywood sausage skillet last night. It was delicious. I try to only eat about a cup of food at dinner WHICH IS PLENTY FOR ME. You would be amazed at how much, visually, a cup of food looks like in a bowl. Tomorrow will be her family recipe for dumpling soup. 

I’ve also been thinking about how did I gain all this weight? I’m carrying around another person on my back. Where did she come from? Years of eating too many calories, stress, a little depression, self-medicating, etc. One big one is, I hate exercise. Always have. Unless it’s disguised as something fun or holds my attention, I won’t do it. I’ve decided to start out with weight training to see how that goes.

Last week I had a few days of diarrhea. That’s not a deal-breaker for me because I have a history of IBS. I’ve started taking a probiotic every day now and that has made a huge difference.  The GERD was pretty bad. I ate a piece of turkey late one night and it traveled up and down my esophagus all night long. I started back on my HCL and that has made all the difference in the world. However, I don’t know if it’s a coincidence but I am now ravenous at night. There has been no appetite suppression at all in the past three evenings.  At first, I thought it was because the Ozempic is wearing off. Then I thought, maybe it’s the HCL emptying my stomach too soon. I will see what happens tonight as I took my second shot last night. The hunger at night keeps me awake and I’m not sleeping until between 2 am and 3 am.  I’m retired, so I don’t have to work the next day but I’m really tired the next day. 

I drink plenty of water and mix in Dr. Berg’s electrolyte powder every other day because I pee so much. 

I’m a type 2 diabetic. My numbers have improved. They should get better with prolonged use of Ozempic. My lowest number so far was 117 during the middle of the day.

So far, I’ve lost 5 pounds in a week on Ozempic which is probably mostly water. I had already started losing weight in March after I had gained 6 pounds on a vacation. My total weight loss so far is 13 pounds, 5 of it with the help of Ozempic. I plan on staying on this for the long haul. I hope you find this information useful.

## Comment 
> I started Ozempic at the beginning of March. It's now May, and I'm on 1mg dosage  and have lost around 7lbs. Am I not doing enough ? It's frustrating because I feel a lot of pressure from my doctor to lose quickly and I'm personally just content knowing my eating habits are changing, even if the scale doesn't as much.

Obviously, I'd love if it did , but noticing myself naturally cutting portions and craving veggies and being able to avoid take out in favor of what I've cooked? That's huge. I'm not doing a ton of calorie cutting or counting get, didn't want to add too many things at once. Am I just hurting myself on this?  

Started at 341ish, down to 332 now, but has been as low as 329. I know water and salt intake can affect that so I'm trying to be gracious with myself, but I could use some support and info from those who might have also had the slow and steady route?

> I have been on ozempic since January and I am down 20lbs. My numbers are improving and I am grateful about that. 

I am finding that I have lost my taste for food. I generally eat a high protein cereal for breakfast, have a glucerna/ensure shake for lunch (with added frozen fruit and veggie supplement) and then at supper I am just so NOT interested in food. 
I was eating an apple when I was hungry up until a couple of weeks ago but have lost my appetite for them. I don't snack and I am just generally not interested in food. I realize this is unhealthy for my body and a bad habit to get into. 
Any tips to start enjoying food more?

I’ve been on Ozempic almost 4 months now and lost 15 pounds so far and my BS numbers are good.

However, my constipation is terrible, I was impacted even. How can I handle this? I’m taking maralax and stool softeners and the occasional stimulant laxative. Now have really bad hemorrhoids and it is quite painful. I would hate to goof the medicine, but being this backed up isn’t healthy.

Should my dose be bumped again? Anyone else here experienced something similar, what made you stop stalling?

## Comment 
> I have been on Ozempic since September. I love it! I do not do much exercise and have lost 70lbs.  I am on once weekly 1MG dose.  It was very hard at first but I pushed through.  I found that Zoffran really helped with the nausea.  I did have to vomit at times but like I said I made it through and it is well worth it.  A1C went from 8.1 to 6.1 in 6 months!  Sugars are under control and I do not crave lots of junk food.  I went from 260 to my current weight 186!   This is not for everyone, but if you can get past the first few months it is well worth it.  Good luck.

## Comment 
> Oh yeah, the ramp up to 1mg across most of the first three months was full of sulfur burps, heartburn, gas, nausea, and all that fun stuff. Eventually, the side effects did settle down and seem to have fully settled out, thank god.

Progress was slow enough that my doctor suggested we try a 2mg/week dose. Did that for a month with really no great improvement, but the cost and logistics of having to cover half that out-of-pocket and coordinate shipping times through Canada was complicated, so we dropped back to 1mg, but added metformin and topiramate. (Have also been on bupropion for years, which had no effect on my appetite.) With that as the cocktail for the last month, my appetite has been pretty low, lower than ever, but - somewhat surprisingly, considering - loss is still just about on the half-pound a week pace.

It's amazing to me how rapid and effective this seems to be for so many, but it's coming along, bit by bit. 250 -&gt; 235 so far.

> I’ve been on ozempic since the beginning of March. So far I have lost like 10 lbs. I love it. I haven’t really changed my lifestyle too much intentionally but I’m losing weight, eating less, and want to exercise more. Here’s the thing…. I got diarrhea mid April and it is still persisting. I went to urgent care, told them my issue and mentioned that I started it in March. The NP said it’s unlikely the symptoms developed this late so it likely isn’t the medicine. I have stopped taking it until I can see a GI in June because urgent care could only help if I was dehydrated or something but all my vitals were normal. 

So I guess my question is - has anyone else had absolute geyser diarrhea since starting ozempic?

## Comment 
> I'm a 44 year old female that started taking ozempic in mid November.  My starting weight was 195lbs. In April ( last month) I was able to get to 182. 
In December I started my 1mg dose of ozempic and for 2 months that I was on that dose I didn't lose a single pound. So I went back to .5mg in March...during this time I gave up sweets and junk food for LENT ...I believe that's what contributed to me being able to go down to 182lbs. However..5mg stopped working for me, I began to feel really hungry and I started eating everything on my plate. My hunger wasn't suppressed like it was before, I wasn't feeling naseous 2 to 3 days after my injection either. So I decided it's time to give 1mg another try ...and this time adding 500mg of metformin twice a day. Well ever since starting metformin I would think it would suppress my hunger, and make me naseous...but nope! Only thing it makes me feel is low blood pressure.  I wasn't aware that metformin can lower blood pressure ( works better than my blood pressure medication ( metoprolol 25mg)...before metformin,  my blood pressure on metoprolol was 135/90....now..my blood pressure on metformin in 95/70
I went up from 182 to 184 pounds. Which makes me angry and disappointed.  Has anyone experienced low blood pressure on metformin?

Also should I stick to the combination (metformin and ozpic?)
I really don't want to go back to 195 or more....and I like that metformin helps lower my blood pressure..im cutting out the metoprolol slowly. 

Please....any advice will help.

Day one (yesterday) I could hardly eat due to nausea and feeling full. I ate lightly but by that night I was vomiting with gusto. I have had food poisoning and never threw up that hard. This morning my weight was down 5 lbs from water loss!!

So many people say they started at 0.25 mg, is 1mg too high? Can I adjust to the nausea starting that high?

My goal weight is 120 but I was wondering, if anyone has experience stopping ozempic after getting to their goal. Did you end up regaining weight or able to keep it off? Although the side effects are tolerable for the weight loss I’d love to eventually not have to deal with them

> Hi all, I was going through a stressful period of life (moving plus a million other things) and I skipped two weeks of my dose. I know, I know. However, I was kind of shocked at how my weight immediately popped back up and it made me concerned that if I ever go off this medication, I am just going to gain all the weight back. 

I gained 7 lbs in the course of 2-3 weeks. It was a rough thing to see this morning. I know I haven't been eating 100% healthy but I haven't been out of control either. 

Anyone else experience this? And yes I know if I don't change my diet I'll gain weight, but I honestly was eating similarly to what I had been eating while on the Ozempic. There were maybe a couple of indulgences here and there but not 7 pounds worth.

What's troubling is the new symptom of constipation which sometimes causes severe abdominal gas pains in my lower left quadrant.

I favor quick fixes but realize that there probably isn't one for this. I'll try increasing my water intake since I hardly drink any. But has anyone had positive results with a laxative, fiber pills, certain food?

With Ozempic , I am waking up at about 8 now, and my day sugars are 5.5-7 range.   I'm feeling much better, not having to pee so often.  Less UTI infections.  

I have lost about 10lbs as well over 2 months of being on it, I hardly feel hungry,    

Negatives - diareah, stomach issues  but it is improving now.

I have def noticed huge change in how my clothes fit and how my body feels. I have pcos insulin resistance and nothing had ever helped before . The one thing that I struggle with is getting on the scale every single day and feeling frustrated about not losing anything that day - also re weighing my self later on that day and feeling upset that the weight has gone up. I know weight can fluctuate through out the day and I should stop obsessing but I can’t stop. I know how unhealthy this can be and how it can lead to an eating disorder( I find myself not eating to avoid gaining any weight) I have come a long way and am happy that I’m losing some weight. Sometimes I can feel obsessed over the number and not seeing more weight come off. Help 

I am also on my 4th week on  1.0 now .

> So I’ve been on Ozempic for a couple months now and I’ve lost nearly 20 lbs. I need to lose the weight both because I’m incredibly unhappy with how I look and because it has a devastating impact on other medical conditions I have.

Although, I’m not sure how much longer I can stand it. 

I’ve been nauseated and vomitting every single day in the evening and morning. Which has severely impacted my ability to do day to day work and chores. And when I tell you that I’ve had the absolute worst stomach pains in my life, I’m not joking- they would be the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced had I not sliced my leg open on a piece of rebar last year. Google of course states “mild to moderate” nausea, vomitting, and stomach upset are to be expected, but this is hardly what I’d classify as “mild to moderate”, more like gastrointestinal hell. It seems to get much worse whenever I lay down to sleep too.

Has anyone else experience such awful side effects? If so, what did you do to make them go away? 

Note: I am taking Ondansetron, but it does very little to actually help.

I’ve lost 3 lbs. God bless people with their “3 months in, lost 30 lbs!” results. Some of us don’t get that. But my A1c is better, and I feel like I’m eating better. I might not ever lose weight. I thought Ozempic would help me move the needle on my weight and other aspects of my health. I’m committed to continuing to use this tool as long as it is bringing me A1c results.

Need some reassurance here. I started Ozempic on 4/7 and the first 9 weeks were amazing - I went from 204 to 176. But in the past couple weeks I've not only stalled but have gone back up a couple pounds. Is this just a plateau? I'm wondering if it's possible my pen lost its effectiveness from the summer heat  and thinking maybe I should try to double dose with a new refridgerated pen. Bad idea???

I've noticed strong different behaviour, 4th month/pen I was never nausious, my hunger came back after the 5th day badly and the difference with my apetite on the 5th pen is so different!! Almost like the beginning! Nausia after I eat normally, can only eat super small portions, craving for fresh and watery foods.(watermelon is my breakfast now) and ugh, some foods are even to dry to swallow. 

Anyway, anyone noticed a difference between batches? I can also see it in my weightloss graph. Last month i hardly lost any, now Im losing some more weight again.

-17 lbs I’ll take that! The first 10-12 were quick it’s slowed down for now. The again so have the side effects - whew. 
Learning to use smaller plates, add some fibre to my protein coffee in morning. (Bought a flavorless one so I’ve actually added to my water at times too). 
Feeling happy I have started this journey, a long way to go as my goal is to be in ‘onederland’ !
Keep pushing through friends, we’ll get there!!

## Comment 
> Background: I suffer from Psoriatric arthritis and was treated with high dose of steroids for a few years, with that I put on a whole lot of weight, 90 pounds in 5 years! Yes I was retaining fluids, but I was also eating a lot, craving carbs, sweets, etc.

I went into remission for the first 5 months of 2021 and my body responded well. During that time my weight dropped from 304 lbs down to 265 in a few months of self motivated conscious eating, making healthier choices, but nothing crazy. My A1C dropped to 5.6 (from 6.5) and everything was going well until my disease came back with a vengeance. Once again I needed steroids, I ate like a mad man, I went back up to 298.

Fast forward: Beginning of March of 2022 I found a new rheumatologist who started me in a different regimen using methotrexate and Humira, stopped oral steroids ( now going through a course of steroid Injections until the new treatment plan fully kicks in

———Now to the Ozempic part———

In April of 2022 I saw my PCP for my anual checkup, he ordered the usual labwork including A1C, returned to the doctor in the end of the month to discuss findings and create a treatment plan. My fasting blood glucose was 170 and A1C 7.2.

It was then where discussed ozempic, he wanted me to start it along with metformin. My weight then was 290  and I was eating a whole lot of everything, craving carb and sweets at bed time. I asked for one of those continuous glucose monitoring devices ( can’t keep pricking my fingers as I use them too much and sanitize them all day)

May 1st I started ozempic (0.25) and metformin. I didn’t really feel any side effects from ozempic, but I sure did get the farts and the shits from the metformin (recently those subsided significantly). 

The second week of ozempic (0.25) I noticed a little heartburn, so I added a table spoon of unfiltered apple cider vinegar to my crystal light lemon Iced tea and that whole heartburn thing went away. I really didn’t notice any changes on my appetite then.

Week 3 and 4 the dose went up (0.5) I still didn’t notice any changes, felt the same.

Fast forward to weeks 5 to 8 dose went up to (1.0) My appetite decreased drastically, along with carb and sugar cravings. The amount of food I ate also decreased, It is like I lost interest in food. While I enjoy what I eat, at that point I no longer chased it.

I did not start a diet or anything, but my eating habits changed for sure. The continuous glucose monitoring device influenced that for sure.

I was able to see that if I ate 2 Oreos ( cookies not sleeves like before) my blood sugar would rise up to 150, on the other hand, when I ate a huge apple, 15 grapes and 6 saltine crackers, it only went up to 130.

I no longer constantly think or worry about what and when I will eat next. I no longer grab a bag of chips and some cookies to munch on while watching tv, because it doesn’t sound appealing sounds “meh”

The best way to describe my appetite is depression. Think about how your mind feels when you’re depressed, nothing interests you, everything is just …”whatever”.

That is what ozempic did to my appetite, food is ok, is just not something I crave. I still enjoy eating, however, my world no longer revolves around it.

I rather cook then eat out any days, I found myself very interested in meats, homemade pasta, rice, lots of veggies and fruit. I really like premier protein shakes, usually have one every day, and occasionally a pure protein bar ( those taste good too).  I enjoy a mug cake with a little bit of Nutella inside topped with whip cream a couple times per week as well. 

Average glucose on the first month was 127, second month 117. Went to my PCP today, current weight is 275!  So that is 15 lbs in 8 weeks, that is significant to me. 

This week we are starting the 2mg dose, which the copay was zero (with insurance) with ozempic’s new 2mg savings program good for 3 refills of 90 days supply so 9 months! Let’s see how that will work out, I’m looking forward to it. ( sorry for the editing, typed on my phone)

## Comment 
> As the title says, after 12 weeks on Ozempic I have lost 11% of my starting.
Started at 0.25mg for 4 weeks
0.5mg for 4 weeks
0.75mg for 2 weeks 
1mg for the remainder.

Definitely noticing some GI issues especially with the higher doses. Also some ongoing fatigue. Otherwise no major side effects. 

I have tried to increase my activity as I'm WFH and spend a lot of time sitting. Also really focusing on increasing my water intake. No unsustainable lifestyle changes though. 

This medication has worked miracles for me!

## Comment 
> Unlike most people on this sub, my doctor put me on Ozempic to help me lower my A1c since I'm Type 2 Diabetic. This condition didn't occur overnight, so I've spent almost 20 years learning how to eat the right foods to lower my blood sugar. But as we all know, there's a huge difference between knowing what to do and having the willpower to do it. Although weight loss wasn't my goal with Ozempic, when I started it I also got serious about healthy eating in respect to blood sugar, which is essentially just a carb-aware diet in which I eliminate or replace high carb foods with lower carb alternatives. (This is MUCH easier than it's ever been, by the way, due to the popularity and recent medical backing of low-carb eating.) I've lost 46 pounds since late January, so I'm pleased with my weight loss results, but more importantly, my doctor is no longer threatening to put me on daily insulin.  

My question to you is: How much have you changed your eating habits along with Ozempic? It's clear that some of you haven't changed a thing and are relying solely on Ozempic for results. Others have made major changes but still feel like they're not seeing the results they hoped for. I made major changes, but Ozempic has made it much, much easier to stick to those changes without a sense of deprivation. But I try not to be one of those people who thinks, ""This is what works for me therefore it's what everyone needs to do,"" so I'm interested to learn what each of you has done, and how well it's working out for you.  

So in short: How have you changed your diet and exercise along with Ozempic, what are your results, and are you happy with how it's all going?

Felt nausea last night for the first time (4th week of 1mg dose, day #96 overall).

I suspect my lunch (Thai restaurant food) and half-pint of beer later in the day had something to do with it. The Ozempic effects must be increasing over time, because this would have been totally fine even two weeks ago.

I ditched dinner and breakfast (had tiny snacks &lt;100 cal instead), and I think that helped, then I had lunch today and the nausea is back.

My lunch today was small so this is turning into a bit of an ""oh sh\*t"" moment. I have this hypothesis that all side-effects can be controlled by eating less... so wish me luck lol!

I’ve been on Ozempic for 3 months (down 20 pounds) and I used to be able to eat like a champ. Last week, all I wanted was pizza (a rare treat) and after eating one slice, I started on a second, and started to vomit.

Apologies for being graphic, but I vomited up food. Not phlegm, not bile, not stomach acid. And I felt fine afterwards. 

Is my stomach smaller? Or is it just that it can’t ‘hold’ as much?

## Comment 
> First off, I’m in the UK and we use a different scale for sugar and HbA1c tests, but they are otherwise the same, just need converting; we use mmol/L rather than mg/dl.

Some background:

I’m a 40yo single gay male (more on the relevance of that later). I’ve been a diabetic for about 15 years and have never been good at controlling it for any decent period of time, or my weight.

I’m using 1.0mg Ozempic as well as Metformin slow release at the full doze (1000mg), Empagliflozin 25mg (again the max dose) and was on Gliclazide for a couple of years before starting on Ozempic.

Most of you will be familiar with Metformin, but to give you some background, Empagliflozin is a fairly new drug that helps the kidneys from processing sugar and diverts it to the bladder, so you’re consuming less. I haven’t had any issues on it myself but because you have a lot of sugar making it’s way into the bladder you have a much greater risk of getting urinary tract infections, and you’ll always be off-the-scale for glucose on urine test strips.

Gliclazide is a fairly old medication that was approved in the early 70’s that makes the pancreas secrete more insulin. For whatever reason it was never made available in the US but I believe there’s other closely related medications that do the same thing.

How I got put on Ozempic:

Being in the UK and having a chronic condition (the diabetes), I’m luckily that I don’t pay for my medication, which I know is a stress point for many on here and something that puts the national healthcare system into focus for me. I order my medication online through my doctors and its available for me to pickup in a day or two.

In early this year, post-Christmas, I was having to use more Gliclazide that I was prescribed for to get my bloods into a more acceptable level, to the point whereby I was otherwise feeling ill.

I put a note on my next prescription order to request a review to but put onto a higher dose and the pharmacist at my doctor’s called me to discuss.
She was concerned that more Gliclazide could be counter productive as you’re making up for over-eating my just popping another pill and therefore it usually makes you put on weight.

After chatting with my doctor she came back with the suggestion of trying Ozempic. A few years ago I was on Victoza and didn’t get on with it, but I was happy to give this a try, especially given that it is a weekly rather than daily injection.

Over the course of 8 weeks I moved from 0.25 to 0.5 to 1.0, the latter which I have been on for about 3 months now.

And now I have been able to see the results of my recent bloods online ahead of my appointment next week…

THE GOOD
- For the first time since my 2009 (as far back as the system shows), my liver is showing that its in the normal range, and quite comfortably in it, which is a major achievement. I hardly drink so it was down to fatty liver disease.

- All of my other bloods; kidneys, urea &amp; electrolytes, and all the other liver function tests are all within their normal ranges. Previously there’s where up and down, but never all within normal, healthy adult ranges.

- My HbA1c is down to 49 mmol/mol from 61 in mid-February, with the normal range being 20-41. it was circa 60 for two years prior to that on Gliclazide and up to 90 before that. As a percentage that’s about 6.5%. So not perfect but signficantly down in just under 6 months.

- My weight is 95.7kg (211lbs) down from 104kg (229lbs) in mid-February. The 104kg was taken at the doctors and the 95.7kg on my own digital scales, so there could be some variation there, but nonetheless a good result.

- I have little to no ongoing side effects with Ozempic after being on the 1.0 for a while.

THE BAD
- I had the usual nausea which has now mostly gone but do feel lousy the next day if I have some chocolate (even just a small snickers) the evening before.

- While I’m not eating half what I used to, I feel the chocolate cravings are starting to come back and I don’t feel the above nausea until the next day, so aren’t put off like I used to be.

- I don’t feel much, if any, benefit of losing the weight. A few years ago I would go through a health streak and feel great after the first couple of days (before giving in as usual), although I appreciate this gets harder with age. I haven’t had any ‘feeling great’ periods nor do I actually feel like I’ve lost any weight. No doubt if I could suddenly switch back to my weight in February, I’d notice a big difference, but I just haven’t felt any day-to-day benefits of note. If anything I’ve lost a lot of weight on my chest and this has caused a big belly appearance like a beer belly, and in some respects I feel worse about my body now than before.

- I’m a single gay male** and my sex drive has significantly reduced. I don’t feel like I’m missing something as such, like I’m depressed, it’s just like I don’t need it any more, which in itself isn’t great. So yes, I feel like I’m missing something but it feels different than depression. Its hard to explain. I posted about this about a month ago and had people saying the same but most were female, and some were saying their sex drive is off-the-scale.

I’ve found it difficult to be interested in sex or be aroused. I’ve started with a week of daily Cialis 2.5mg that I bought online from a reputable UK-based online pharmacy and that has made no difference. I’ve doubled the dose to 5mg (the highest of the two daily Cialis doses) as of today to see if that makes any difference, but I’m not getting my hopes up.

**Like it or not, we typically have more sex than most straight people of my age, so I add this as being a relevant point for full transparency. My sex life was important to me and that has pretty much just dried up.


THE UGLY

Well I’m sorry to end on a bum note but I feel like I need to be honest. I’m just not enjoying life as much as I used to before Ozempic. It feels like everything from sex to food to music to enjoying a coffee has been dialled down.

Now obviously the go-to explanation to this would be depression but I’m not feeling the obvious depression symptoms of not wanting to do anything or feeling lost or helpless, or about to start tasks before not bothering, and otherwise there have been no circumstances of life that have otherwise changed that would explain depression. If anything, the significant increase in my health metrics should have the opposite effect, but they haven’t.

Someone touched on this before and it really hit a note with me that I couldn’t put my finger on before: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/vbbhzl/feeling_depressed_not_enjoying_life_on_ozempic/

I appreciate this has been a long post but I thought my two cents might be useful for some of you out there and I’d love to hear from anyone of you with similar or opposing experiences.

> I'm not breaking any speed records, which is a-okay with me, but wanted to share! I got my bloodwork done at the end of March, started cleaning up my eating and taking Metformin then, and started Oz in mid May. 

Since all that started, I'm down 6% of my body weight, and my total Cholesterol is down 34 points! All my Cholesterol numbers are heading in the right direction. My glucose and A1C are down a little bit, too.

I like the weight loss, I couldn't get the scale to budge before Ozempic, but I also really love the effect on my bloodwork. I'm hopeful that when I get to 10%, numbers will be even better. It's life changing to even have a realistic thought that I will be able to lose 10%!

Thanks for reading, I appreciate all of the support here!

## Comment 
> Yesterday made me feel really good about the progress I’ve been making. I was diagnosed with T2D in May of 2021. I was on Metformin and januvia, following WW, and exercising. I was able to lose about 30 lbs in a 9 month timeframe. I started taking Oz in April. I’m on week 13 (6th dose 1mg will be tomorrow). I knew going into this medication that I may not see weight loss right away. My weight loss has been slow, about 10lbs since I started ( really since I got to 1mg dose). 

NSV: yesterday I attended an in person work event. I bought a dress a few months ago expecting to wear it to a wedding in August. The dress fit fine when I bought it, I really liked how I looked in it. But it was a little loose in the chest and back. I’m happy with this but also a bit sad because I don’t think I can wear it again without getting it altered. That was victory #1. 

Victory # 2 was later in the day when I went to get my hair cut. Normally I hate when they put the cap on and I’m staring at myself in the mirror. Double chin, thick neck, always made me self conscious and want to cry. This hair cut was different. No double chin!!!! Well, maybe a small one when my stylist told me to look down, but it was less pronounced. My next didn’t look like a stuffed sausage for once when the cap was snapped up. 🤩

I’m pretty disappointed in the weight results but my glucose readings are so much better. My A1C went from 7.2 to 6.8. I still need to lose about 40 pounds. I’m having very few side effects and eating less than I was but no great loss of appetite like a lot of others have. If I don’t start losing better the doctor said there is no problem with going to 2.0. Anyone else in my boat?? Thanks

## Comment 
> Bottom line: I’ve been on Ozempic for a little over a year now, which led me to an amazing weight loss journey (combined with very strict diet and heavy workout sessions). On January, I had to dismiss the personal trainer who was working with me and couldn’t keep up with the nutritionist appointments because of money issues - specially because Ozempic is so freaking expensive where I live. 

On November I reduced the dose from to 1 to .5 and it worked great. But then on march I felt like my appetite was off the rails and I went back to 1.

For the past 4 or 5 months I don’t think it’s working to reduce my appetite like it did before and I actually gained 5 pounds, which really concerned me. My doctor considered giving me some psychiatric drugs to help, but I’m not really sure if I can afford a new treatment right now. Has anyone felt the same?

> I started taking ozemspic about 8 weeks ago and kept doing my normal eating and drinking of whatever I wanted all while praying for some help to get myself in check. I always try to find something that would work for me to really help me loose weight. It hit me 4 weeks into this,  ozemspic really does work. I got focused on everything I put in my mouth, stopped with the bullshit eating and drinking and told myself that I am worth it. I am down 28 pounds. I have never been able to say that previously. The part that gets me is that being 28 pounds down from 409 feels so good and I want more. I’m not winded going up the steps and can move so much better. I have a very long way to go but I’m learning that habits define success. Ozemspic will work if you work with it. I never post about my weight, please don’t give up on yourself. I love this group and all y’all in here.

## Comment 
> I am on ozempic for BS management, I chose Oz because of the side effects of weight loss, of course losing weight will help my health and BS so here I am. When I was first Dx with Diabetes I was 225lbs but I have been heavier and just nothing worked for reducing weight, Oz has.  I started this med in July and am now down to 197lbs, my husband is worried that I am ""melting too quickly with no sign of stopping"". Admittedly, I am so excited to have dropped weight quickly and am not excited for it to slow because I have huge body issues (I know, not a healthy outlook). But I am trying to determine what a goal weight would be. I have a very large frame as a woman and when I look at target weights, the charts say 136 because I am 5' 4"" but omg I would look gross and weird at 136. How does everyone figure out an ideal weight that will work with individual body types?

## Comment 
> I started Ozempic about a year ago. I had lost a bit of weight prior to that -- maybe 20-30 lbs. Since starting Ozempic, my total weight loss is 113 lbs. The weight loss has slowed down, but it is still effective at curbing my appetite and reducing my binging. I've hit some plateaus, but working with my doctor have powered through them. I have a ways to go and know that Ozempic isn't magic, but if you're feeling frustrated -- keep going!! You can do it!

Food is hard to get in but I’m doing protein and greens shakes with oat milk for calories. Just wanted to stop in and say thanks, there’s been a ton of great information on here!

Has anyone gone BACK or STAYED on .25 and successfully lost weight and had minimal side effects?

If anyone has chia recipes please share. I need to incorporate more. TIA

In the past a vacation like that would put me 10 lbs over! I was able to keep it under control with the appetite suppression effect.  I ate whatever I wanted, I just could only fit in about 1/3 of what I would eat normally.  Feeling so great going into my fifth week!

Is there anything I can do to lose more weight? The side effects of 1.0 have worn off now. I can eat but not a lot. (Current weight is 274.) I am also trying to drink a half gallon of water a day but I fail to most days. I also skipped the shot for 2 weeks due to side effects (didn’t want to feel sick as I went back to college.) 

What can I do to lose more weight with this injection? Many assume due to my weight alone that I binge but I don’t. Today I had less than 1,200 calories because I just felt full. (I do track my calories.)

I'm 43(f), SW 295, CW 270.

In June, my liver count was scary, as well as my blood glucose. I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease and diabetes type 2. But today, after losing 25 lbs, my numbers went from...

Glucose: 175 to 101 (99 is top of healthy range)
SGOT/AST: 48 to 30 (healthy range!)
SGPT/ALT: 76 to 46 (healthy range!!)

I am THRILLED!!! I've been happy with the weight loss, but seeing measurable improvement in these numbers is such a relief and a real motivator to keep going.

Just wanted to share and would love to read other happy health updates!

## Comment 
> I am a newish T2. I was diagnosed at the end of May with an A1c of 14. I was put on insulin, metformin, and Ozempic. I came off the insulin pretty quick and my numbers are significantly better. According to my CGM my A1c is around 5.9 now. I have lost 61 pounds since my diagnosis. I do have some side effects with Ozempic but it has really been a magical drug for me. I have always struggled with high blood pressure and a high heart rate. Since starting Ozempic, I have gotten to come off one blood pressure medicine, and my average heart rate has dropped 20 points. 

All sounds great right? Well, my job has changed insurance companies and they don’t want to cover my Ozempic. I had to get a pre-authorization approved for a medicine I have been on for months. I was told initially that I just have to be prescribed Metformin and it should be approved. Well that’s not the case. My insurance has denied it. I am being told that I don’t have enough proof that I was sick enough to need Ozempic. WTF? Why should an insurance company be able to dictate what medication I need and why? The person who signed the denial letter was a Pharmacist, which is not a doctor. I plan on appealing but the appeal process says it can take up to 90 days, which means I am going to have to come out of pocket for the medicine or go off of it. 

I just don’t understand. I have worked so hard to try and get control of this disease, but I feel like I am being punished for working hard. Part of me wants to give up. I truly feel like this journey would be exponentially harder without Ozempic. 

Anyone else struggled with this? Anyone have any tips or advice on how to afford this medication? I wish there was like a separate insurance I could private pay for that just covers prescription drugs… This whole situation is just such garbage and it pisses me off so much. 😡

## Comment 
> I'm curious what an average day of eating looks like for everyone and how its changed since starting OZ. (Sorry if this is a post already) I'm finding that it's easy for me to skip meals on OZ, leading to low blood sugar, etc, so I'm trying to eat more small, consistent meals/snacks throughout the day. Some of my go to's are: 
  -overnight oats with chia/hemp seeds (super helpful for constipation)
  -protein shakes and bars when I can't be bothered to make anything, haha 
  -yogurt 
  -fruit and nuts/crackers 
 I also am eating most of the foods I normally do, just in much smaller quantities. Pasta with veggies/protein, lots of Mexican foods, soups, etc.

Before OZ I had a bad habit of not eating all day then having a big meal/snacks at night. While I'm still working on eating consistently throughout the day, it's gotten much better for me on this med.

## Comment 
> Hi all,
Last year I switched from Victoza to Ozempic. Symptoms  were tolerable except when I would go hiking. I hike once a week with some friends, typically 7-11 miles, with periods of tough inclines.
After I started Ozempic, I would become too I'll to hike and would have to abort, rest, and return. Nausea, vomiting, and generally unwell all over. Ultimately I had to stop taking Ozempic. I had lost 30lbs in 5 months, and unfortunately, put it back over the next 8 months. 
Now I'm reconsidering - I've seen several references in Reddit, and also a formal study, the say that Zofran works well to stop the nausea and vomiting. So I'm thinking of talking with my Endo about trying Ozempic again and also an Rx for Zofran (generic Ondansetron), and take it before hiking. 
Anybody have other advice? Other antiemetics? Ideas?

## Comment 
> I previously posted about getting my MIL, who doesn't understand computers in the least, on Ozempic.

In the end, we're going to through Mark's Marine in Canada as her insurance continued to deny coverage.   I help her with ordering online.   She's been on it for about a month and has already lost 5 lbs. 

In November, she's coming up to WA state to spend Thanksgiving with myself and my husband.   Since we're only a few hours from the Canadian border, I think it'll be a good idea to just go up there and buy several pens from the pharmacy (we already talked to them about buying in person and they said it's fine as long as we have an RX, which my MIL does).

I have a small, handheld cooler that I plan to take with me and fill with ice for the return trip.   This part is easy to do.

We are, however, flying because my MIL can't sit for long periods of time in a car due to sciatica, so we've made the decision to fly as it's a very short flight from Seattle.   I know that people with meds that need refrigeration and extra handling take these things through airport security all the time.  I just want to make sure we're fully prepared for bringing it back from Canada to the US.  

Does anyone have any experience with this?  Do we need to declare anything at customs?  We'll have a copy of her prescription to cover bases.  I'm probably overthinking this but want to make sure we don't get stopped or have anything bad happen considering the price of the pens.

Thanks!

## Comment 
> Updated: I dropped a few pounds right after this post!! 

Original: On my first month of Ozempic, I could count on a loss of appetite within hours, and my glucose response was noticeable. I lost 13 pounds in August, 7 1/2 pounds in September, and only half a pound so far  for all of October. Most of the weight loss for 6-7 weeks has been “2 pounds lost, a pound gained, half a pound lost, 1 1/2 pounds gained”, nothing steady at all, which was s disconcerting.

My blood lipids came back better though and I’m still seeing my glucose more stabilized. But I really am wondering now if Ozempic will result in the drastic weight loss I need because at my highest weight, I would have been eligible for bariatric surgery and now I’m just shy of being eligible. I know with bariatric I would lose the weight but being diabetic, of course there’s a greater risk of side effects. 

I’m good with healthy weight loss but feel a pound a month isn’t…it’s not worth it, is it? Should I try Mounjaro? Or am I just predestined to stay fat? I literally can gain 2 pounds eating any dinner with carbs over 30. I do not want to go into ketoacidosis because I want to preserve my kidneys. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. Today was the first time in three months that I woke up to a weight gain the day after my injection. I had two bowls of vegetable soup yesterday, and a grilled cheese sandwich at midnight, so what—900 calories? (i work shift work and never sleep before 4am.) I’m so sad.

I had Excruciating muscle ache and joint pain in the last three weeks and  just diagnosed with hyperthyroidism with inflammation . I was told it is not related to Ozempic at all.
Has anybody heard a similar experience?

I do take a combination of metformin (2 once per day) and Ozempic 1mg once per week! Truly didn’t understand how insulin resistance caused me difficulty with weight loss over the years! I will have my 6 month bloodwork next week…so fingers crossed 🤞🏾

I am highly motivated to change my lifestyle (already down 10 lbs just with dietary changes in the the last week) but I have a lot of weight to lose. Sw 340 cw 320 gw 150.  Is there anyone who hasn't had these side effects? I also have had gallbladder issues in the past and pancreatic cancer runs in my family.  Ozempic just seems too good to be true, but so did phen/phen.

My weight loss has really slowed down and it was going to be close but I got put on prednisone and I gained 5lb in 3 days.

But I am being positive about it:  The prednisone is for sciatica which I developed over the last few weeks and has really caused me limp around.  Sunday the pain was terrible trying to walk up steps was almost impossible.   

I am grateful for the 97lbs I have lost because I would have been unable to do anything due to the pain and my weight.

My husband is doing the injection for me cos I’m a chicken, and he was nervous (lol we’re both chickens) and as soon as it got to the end he pulled it out. There was a tiny amount of blood this time (second dose, He did it right last time). No liquid on my thigh or anything. 


Also, first week, down 3.1 lbs!! Woohoo

> I'm 35 years old male 5'9 type 2 for around 3 years.  Heres my progress so far:

* pre december 2021: weight of 292 lbs, fasting blood sugar above 11.0 mmol/l (200mg/dl), blood pressure in danger range of 160/140
* december 2021-april 2022, went on ozempic after hearing how amazing it was
* crazy ozempic side affects, diarrhea, stomach pain, bloating, vomitting (HORRIBLE!!) on the 1mg, lasted about 1 week. Weight loss of 10 lbs or so from loss of appetite, which I gained back after I adjusted.
* blood sugar dropped to 7-8.0 (130-150) after 3 or 4 months of use of ozempic, started taking bp meds and my bp went down to 125/90
* progress stalled from about april 2022.
* August 2022 heard about intermittent fasting on youtube (dr sten ekberg, dr jason fung, jason deleur).
* From August, worked my way up from 16 hour intermittent fasting and one 24 hour per week extended fast, now at 2.5 days extended fast per week and 18 hour intermittent fast for rest of the week.  Combine with a lower carb diet and more exercise (walking)
* Todays results: my weight dropped to \~260lbs (-30lbs).  Blood sugar went down to 5.1 (90mg/dl), blood pressure went down to 120/80. Cut down on my metformin to only when I feel like it (LOL).  Stopped taking my blood pressure meds altogether, maybe 1 time per week, and even the ozempic is starting to be unnecessary.

Today I did my 3 month weigh in. I am down 35 pounds.  Started at 256 and I am at 221 as of today on my Doctors scales. 

I am at the point I need to go buy new clothes as I am starting to look like I am a kid wearing my Dads clothes. 

Feel fantastic.  Very few side effects other than weight loss. 

Mild heart burn. 1 day a week I have some nausea which is usually day 3 or 4 after injection. 

I have to take injection in am. If I do it at night I have a hard time going to sleep that night. 

I have been asked this week if I had some type of gastric surgery. 

I hope if you are just beginning Ozempic that you will hang in there. This stuff is life changing.

After Post Edit Note:  Before I started my first dose I watched a Tik Toc testimony of a lady that moved her injection site from her stomach to her thigh. So I have always injected into my thigh after seeing this. I feel this has helped and is part of the limited side effects I have experienced as I keep reading this makes a difference.

## Comment 
> Background: I suffer from Psoriatric arthritis and was treated with high dose of steroids for a few years, with that I put on a whole lot of weight, 90 pounds in 5 years! Yes I was retaining fluids, but I was also eating a lot, craving carbs, sweets, etc.

I went into remission for the first 5 months of 2021 and my body responded well. During that time my weight dropped from 304 lbs down to 265 in a few months of self motivated conscious eating, making healthier choices, but nothing crazy. My A1C dropped to 5.6 (from 6.5) and everything was going well until my disease came back with a vengeance. Once again I needed steroids, I ate like a mad man, I went back up to 298.

Fast forward: Beginning of March of 2022 I found a new rheumatologist who started me in a different regimen using methotrexate and Humira, stopped oral steroids ( now going through a course of steroid Injections until the new treatment plan fully kicks in

———Now to the Ozempic part———

In March of 2022 I saw my PCP for my anual checkup, he ordered the usual labwork including A1C, returned to the doctor in the end of the month to discuss findings and create a treatment plan. My fasting blood glucose was 170 and A1C 7.2.

It was then where discussed ozempic, he wanted me to start it along with metformin. Feb weight was 304, started metformin in March,  My weight then was 290 and I was eating a whole lot of everything, craving carb and sweets at bed time. I asked for one of those continuous glucose monitoring devices ( can’t keep pricking my fingers as I use them too much and sanitize them all day)

May 1st I started ozempic (0.25) along withmetformin. I didn’t really feel any side effects from ozempic, but I sure did get the farts and the shits from the metformin (recently those subsided significantly).

The second week of ozempic (0.25) I noticed a little heartburn, so I added a table spoon of unfiltered apple cider vinegar to my crystal light lemon Iced tea and that whole heartburn thing went away. I really didn’t notice any changes on my appetite then.

Week 3 and 4 the dose went up (0.5) I still didn’t notice any changes, felt the same.

Fast forward to weeks 5 to 8 dose went up to (1.0) My appetite decreased drastically, along with carb and sugar cravings. The amount of food I ate also decreased, It is like I lost interest in food. While I enjoy what I eat, at that point I no longer chased it.

I did not start a diet or anything, but my eating habits changed for sure. The continuous glucose monitoring device influenced that for sure.

I was able to see that if I ate 2 Oreos ( cookies not sleeves like before) my blood sugar would rise up to 150, on the other hand, when I ate a huge apple, 15 grapes and 6 saltine crackers, it only went up to 130.

I no longer constantly think or worry about what and when I will eat next. I no longer grab a bag of chips and some cookies to munch on while watching tv, because it doesn’t sound appealing sounds “meh”

The best way to describe my appetite is depression. Think about how your mind feels when you’re depressed, nothing interests you, everything is just …”whatever”.

That is what ozempic did to my appetite, food is ok, is just not something I crave. I still enjoy eating, however, my world no longer revolves around it.

I rather cook then eat out any days, I found myself very interested in meats, homemade pasta, rice, lots of veggies and fruit. I really like premier protein shakes, usually have one every day, and occasionally a pure protein bar ( those taste good too). I enjoy a mug cake with a little bit of Nutella inside topped with whip cream a couple times per week as well.

Average glucose on the first month was 127, second month 117. Went to my PCP today, current weight is 275! So that is 15 lbs in 8 weeks, that is significant to me.

This week we are starting the 2mg dose, which the copay was zero (with insurance) with ozempic’s new 2mg savings program good for 3 refills of 90 days supply so 9 months! Let’s see how that will work out, I’m looking forward to it. ( sorry for the editing, typed on my phone)

\_—————— update ————-

So 2 weeks ago I went from 1mg to 2mg, I took the 2mg dose at once.

* ‘I felt Sick, bloated, and experienced sulfur burps for the first time in my life!
* could not eat for over 36 hours  

   * after that I was able to eat little by little but not much at all, don’t think I managed more than 1000 calories in a day!

last week I decided to take 1mg on Wednesday and 1mg on Saturday (38 clicks of the 2mg pen)

* first shot was ok I was able to eat some, did not have any side effects
* second shot I felt ok on that day, and I ate picles, olives, carrots, 1 ramem, some chicken, a protein shake, a protein bar, a wheat bread grilled cheese and a slice of the same 45 calorie bread with Nutella, that was less than 1500 calories.  

   * woke up bloated and nauseous, my belly felt like a rock, no sulfur burps
   * could Not eat anything, just the thought of food made me nauseous  

      * all I had that day was Diet Coke, lots of water, 3 table spoons of honey and my multi vitamin gummy ( am on metformin didn’t want to crash)
      * the very next day I had the same felling, albeit a little less, still did not eat anything, again lots of water, some diet coke, vitamin gummy, and some salt ( I literally ate salt because I needed sodium) and honey it’s been over 50 hours since I last ate any substantial amount of food! I know I need to eat, I am just not hungry and still feel full.

my wife just convinced me to try a little bit of watermelon right now to see how I feel (good potassium and fiber source!)

I was supposed to take 1mg later today, but I think I will approach this differently and try 1mg every 4-5 days depending on how I’m feeling, and eventually build up to the 2mg every week ( splitting the dose still)

—————— update————-

I just had a zoom meeting with my doctor to follow up, as we do every week and today we were talking about adjusting the dose. For context, I started 2mg around 3 weeks ago.

* the first week of the 2mg dose, I followed his instructions and went from 1 straight up to 2mg, which was a mistake, too big of a jump made me really feel the side effects (minus headache and lethargy as those have gone away on weeks 8-10)
* the second week of 2mg, I split the dose into two injections of 1mg twice within that week, also felt the side effects similar to the week before.

‘Now we are trying something different, 1mg every 4-5 days, (2mg total every 8-10 days versus every 7) and it is working much better! I can eat, am not so bloated, not having cravings, keeping up well with hydration, it’s fair to say that we are in the right path!

———— update ———— current situation——-

&amp;#x200B;

a1c drop to 4.8, fasting glucose 76, trigs and cholesterol way down to 132 and 129, heart function increased from 54 to 64% (normal) 

progressed, all the way to 2mg as dr recommended, got supper sick at 2mg, learned from my body, tapered down to 1mg every 4-6 days, then every 6-8 days….

stilll having amazing weight loss, muscle gains, SW was 304 before  March when I started metformin, and may I started ozempic. im a 5’10 guy. Weight loss was almost not existent with metformin, and it took me 8-10 weeks on ozempic to notice a substancial difference, wasn’t until July 30th 2.5 months in that I noticed i was 25-30 pounds down, and ever since, it’s been a solid loss of 10 or so pounds per month, with muscle grains in between.

today I’m 227, that’s 75 lbs down, including 12 lbs of muscle gain, Lots of energy, averaging 1500 kcals daily, some days OMAD, 1-2 days a week I do dirty fasting ( where I only take minerals, suplements, protein shots and water, my only side effect left over is bloating, but fiber drinks everyother day, simethicone, and ginger tea helps out a lot. Oh and the ocasional headache 12 hours after the shot, but I attribute that to having to take chemo, and humira which some times lands on shot day, and the day after, my muscles are sore. I take b12 weekly and lift weights almost every day at home!

GGs to you! I’m hoping to ditch this 27 lbs by the end of March and finish 100 lbs lost. Might go down another 10,20, and Bulk up my muscles. I’d generally look skinny at 180 even at 5’10’’ but I’ve alreeady went from 46-48 pants down to 36, and am only looking to go down 1 more pant size to 34. So I’m doing weight training, stretching, planking and squatting at home, so I can keeep up my strong legs, gain some more gluteus muscles, and continue to grow chest and arms, it’s funny that I can fit on my shirts nowadays but the arms and chest feel tight, I can’t flex if the material doesn’t stretch, but it fits so well on the tummy and waist. It’s a whole transformation.

I have been on Oz here in the UK (diagnosed T2 and PCOS) for 4 months. I am 5’7 and 110kg, I used to weigh 65kg 5 years ago. I did 0.25mg for 1 month, 0.5mg for 1 month and 1mg for 2 months. I have lost nothing, in fact on 1mg I have gained 5kg (almost 16lb) I have felt no appetite suppression, I am ravenous as always. I know I have been taking doses correctly etc and had side affects at 1mg - slight heartburn. Is this is? Is this medication not for me then? I can’t see anything else changing as 2mg+ is not available in the Uk. Just looking for a sanity check.

## Comment 
> I had previously been on Oz for t2 and weight loss and found myself doing really well: eating mindfully, choosing healthier options and portions and exercising more. I went from 290 to 225. After feeling totally exhausted and having a handful of really bad side effects from Oz I thought I needed to stop taking it. As a result I gained nearly allllll of my weight back.

Well I’m back at it keeping a very slow pace and trying to stay motivated. 

Does anyone have similar experience ? Any words of wisdom after you’ve fallen off and now back on ? Thanks :)

## Comment 
> I've been on this combo for a little over a year. My last A1C I was down to a 7! Lost about 30lbs in a year's time which is good because I do zero exercise and sit at a desk job.

2 questions does anyone still get the entire upset stomach still after being on ozempic this long if eating bad? I had Mexican last night and stomach rumbles all day so far. I didn't eat excessive. I usually drink a gallon of Pepto and it seems to help.

And after being on it so long I'm scared that if I come off my weight is going to creep back up. Has anyone been off ozempic and gained back?

Prior to actually caring about myself and diabetes at one point in my life I weighed about 220, I'm only 5'3/5'4. I have no pictures of myself because I was ashamed of the way I looked. Now I regret not having pics.

I'm currently down to 130/135 and wear a size 8. Loving life for now, but I'm so fearful about the holidays and gaining. 

I think I need a friend for daily motivational support 😁

I have been wearing the same jeans since my fat days and I finally went out and bought a couple new pairs… in a store! Instead of online only sizing! I even needed a smaller size than I thought!

One roll, 2 corn “ribs”, and a bite of cheesecake had us as stuffed as a thanksgiving meal. Before Ozempic we would both have bread, appetizer, meal, and dessert. 
I’m 22 pounds down in 6 weeks!

No side effects.

Oh the weight loss has been crazy too, down 37 lbs on my home scale and 29 lbs on my doctor’s scale.

## Comment 
> I started Ozempic in Oct 2021 while waiting for gastric sleeve surgery (also diabetic). I was gradually ramped up in dose like most: 0.25mg x 4 weeks, 0.50mg x 4 weeks, then 1mg ever since.

I lost zero weight until I got to the 1mg dose. At that point, I proceeded to lose up to 80 pounds by Sept 2022. Not bad.

Ultimately I went from 317 lbs to 237. I enjoyed a “lowest ever” weight for about two days. 

Since then, the weight has started to return. No change in any routines (eating, sleeping, exercise, nor meds).

I am now at 250 pounds and concerned. My appetite seems to have returned as well. 

Perhaps it’s time to move up to 2mg doses.

I’m not asking for advice. I’m sharing that this is still a fairly new drug and we don’t know everything about post-use / long term trials. It may be that this stuff wears off or that you  build up a tolerance.

1. Always be thankful for when it is working.
2. Try to be realistic about your goals. I’m happy I lost 80 but never really celebrated because I was always looking around the corner for the next 5 pounds to disappear. Stop and smell the roses every now and again.

I’ll report back if I can get this thing to turn back around.

Update 1: I realize today that because I have lost 80 pounds that my caloric expenditure also drops. I’m no longer burning as much calories as I used to just moving my body around because it’s 80 pounds lighter. Therefore I need to adjust my chloric intake appropriately. I am also still leaning heavily towards raising my dosage to 2 mg from 1 mg.

I have worked up to this dose over about 3 months with 25 Lb weight loss. Doc says I can go up on dose up to 8 mg/ month and doesn't care if I want  to split dose. Any suggestions?

And Im relapsing with my binge eating.  Even though it makes me feel awful I do it anyway.  Im not sure how to get it back under control before its too late.

## Comment 
> Hey all, happy holidays. I had gained about 60lbs since 2020. Last June ( 2022) my Endo prescribed Ozempic. I feel like I lost 20lbs in the first few months on the lower doses, and then it stalled. She bumped me up to 1mg, and I’ve lost only 2 pounds in a few months. Since the 2mg is in such short supply, I’ve been staying on the 1mg. A local mom and pop will be getting the 2mg in, and I will have it by Friday. 


My question is, when did most of you really start seeing the weight loss? Am I excited for nothing about the 2mg? I was just hoping to see a bit more weight loss. I’d really appreciate some feedback. Thanks a bunch!

I have really struggled with exercise because of weakness and energy levels so I am at a loss on what to do next. I am happy my body is lighter but sad at it's state visually.

Suggestions?

> I’m on 1mg and happy here. I’ve lost 30 lbs since starting and hope to lose 30 more as my goal. I do have some questions when I reach my target weight. 

When I hit that goal, do I stay on to maintain? Do people get off Ozempic and gain the weight back? Am I on it for the rest of my life? Does the hunger come back when you get off? 

I’m curious what the long term looks like. Is this a maintenance medication for years? Do I eventually plateau? Any insight in your personal journeys would be greatly appreciated! Happy holidays my fellow Ozzies.

## Comment 
> Here's my timeline (I'm a 5'5"" female in my 40's): 

🔹️April 2017: Diagnosed Type 2 diabetes with 6.9 A1C

🔹️June 2018: 7.9 A1C, I start Metformin and later Glipizide (no diet changes, so still eating high carb)

🔹️June 2019: 6.9 A1C

🔹️July 2019: I start keto (no other changes - I weigh approx 290 lbs at this point)

🔹️October 2019: 6.2 A1C (I'm down to approx 270 lbs)

🔹️November 2019: I start exercising (I'm down to approx 260 lbs)

🔹️January 2020: I switch from keto to low-carb (I'm down to approx 255 lbs)

Over the next several months I make some medication changes, first to change timing of Glipizide (take in evening instead of morning to better match timing for most of my food consumption) and later to replace Glipizide with Ozempic. Also reduced Metformin from 2,000 to 1,000.

🔹️October 2020: A1C 5.6 (I'm down to approx 245 lbs)

🔹️November 2021: I switch from low-carb back to keto (no other changes) (I'm back up to approx 255 lbs)

🔹️April 2022: A1C 5.6 (I'm back down to 245 lbs)

🔹️May 2022: I switch from keto back to low-carb

Unfortunately, there were far too many changes between the October 2019 A1C of 6.2 and the October 2020 A1C of 5.6 for me to know how much impact each change had individually. And given that the 6.2 A1C was only a few months into reduced carb consumption, I can't rule out the possibility that my pancreas was still repairing damage and that those repairs later helped bring my A1C down to the 5.6. Just too many variables to know.

I find that my blood sugar temporarily goes up when I exercise (presumably a stress hormone effect of intense exercise) so it's likely triggering an insulin reaction, which is counter to the purpose of keto. I suspect that, for me, I have to choose either fat loss or muscle gain and not try to do both, so for now I am exercising and getting stronger and maybe at some point I will try another round of keto without exercise to see if it allows me to lose some more fat. Since low carb plus exercise or keto plus exercise gives me the same 5.6 A1C - though presumably my pancreas has to work a bit harder when I eat more carbs - I don't feel a strong incentive to restrict myself to keto levels all the time, and post-exercise recovery seems to be faster and easier when I have a few extra carbs (brain fog and fatigue are rather intense for a day or two without the carbs). I'm hoping the exercise is at least giving my pancreas a little help with the extra carbs. I seem to have two states: 1) Drop the carbs, don't exercise, and lose fat or 2) increase carbs a little and exercise, but effectively be unable to lose fat. Maybe I'm doing something wrong when I go all-in on keto, or maybe I'm misinterpreting my experiences? 🤷‍♀️ For now I am trying to listen to my body and just make sure my overall health is steadily improving. If my body wants to prioritize muscle gain over fat loss right now, I am ok with that. For now. My body only let me drop approx 1/3 of the excess fat, so I'm going to have to push it again at some point. But from a survival standpoint extra fat is less of a risk than insufficient muscle (as long as blood sugar is under control), so I can kinda see why my body might be feeling it needs to do something about the muscle issue before it allows me to drop more fat. 

NOTE: Some of this is a very individual reaction type of thing. My husband and my brother and I are all Type 2's and all three of us have different challenges and reactions to medications, dietary changes, and exercise. Definitely not a one-size-fits-all disease.

One thing I've found fascinating is that though my weight and body measurements haven't changed significantly over the past 2 years, my strength and endurance have greatly improved as a result of the exercise.

## Comment 
> Here's my timeline (I'm a 5'5"" female in my 40's): 

🔹️April 2017: Diagnosed Type 2 diabetes with 6.9 A1C

🔹️June 2018: 7.9 A1C, I start Metformin and later Glipizide (no diet changes, so still eating high carb)

🔹️June 2019: 6.9 A1C

🔹️July 2019: I start keto (no other changes - I weigh approx 290 lbs at this point)

🔹️October 2019: 6.2 A1C (I'm down to approx 270 lbs)

🔹️November 2019: I start exercising (I'm down to approx 260 lbs)

🔹️January 2020: I switch from keto to low-carb (I'm down to approx 255 lbs)

Over the next several months I make some medication changes, first to change timing of Glipizide (take in evening instead of morning to better match timing for most of my food consumption) and later to replace Glipizide with Ozempic. Also reduced Metformin from 2,000 to 1,000.

🔹️October 2020: A1C 5.6 (I'm down to approx 245 lbs)

🔹️November 2021: I switch from low-carb back to keto (no other changes) (I'm back up to approx 255 lbs)

🔹️April 2022: A1C 5.6 (I'm back down to 245 lbs)

🔹️May 2022: I switch from keto back to low-carb

Unfortunately, there were far too many changes between the October 2019 A1C of 6.2 and the October 2020 A1C of 5.6 for me to know how much impact each change had individually. And given that the 6.2 A1C was only a few months into reduced carb consumption, I can't rule out the possibility that my pancreas was still repairing damage and that those repairs later helped bring my A1C down to the 5.6. Just too many variables to know.

I find that my blood sugar temporarily goes up when I exercise (presumably a stress hormone effect of intense exercise) so it's likely triggering an insulin reaction, which is counter to the purpose of keto. I suspect that, for me, I have to choose either fat loss or muscle gain and not try to do both, so for now I am exercising and getting stronger and maybe at some point I will try another round of keto without exercise to see if it allows me to lose some more fat. Since low carb plus exercise or keto plus exercise gives me the same 5.6 A1C - though presumably my pancreas has to work a bit harder when I eat more carbs - I don't feel a strong incentive to restrict myself to keto levels all the time, and post-exercise recovery seems to be faster and easier when I have a few extra carbs (brain fog and fatigue are rather intense for a day or two without the carbs). I'm hoping the exercise is at least giving my pancreas a little help with the extra carbs. I seem to have two states: 1) Drop the carbs, don't exercise, and lose fat or 2) increase carbs a little and exercise, but effectively be unable to lose fat. Maybe I'm doing something wrong when I go all-in on keto, or maybe I'm misinterpreting my experiences? 🤷‍♀️ For now I am trying to listen to my body and just make sure my overall health is steadily improving. If my body wants to prioritize muscle gain over fat loss right now, I am ok with that. For now. My body only let me drop approx 1/3 of the excess fat, so I'm going to have to push it again at some point. But from a survival standpoint extra fat is less of a risk than insufficient muscle (as long as blood sugar is under control), so I can kinda see why my body might be feeling it needs to do something about the muscle issue before it allows me to drop more fat. 

NOTE: Some of this is a very individual reaction type of thing. My husband and my brother and I are all Type 2's and all three of us have different challenges and reactions to medications, dietary changes, and exercise. Definitely not a one-size-fits-all disease.

One thing I've found fascinating is that though my weight and body measurements haven't changed significantly over the past 2 years, my strength and endurance have greatly improved as a result of the exercise. I'm not sure if my body has simply been removing fat from areas where it needs space for additional muscle while also removing fat from areas not usually measured (such as my face) or if there's some other explanation, but clearly there's some kind of change happening. It used to be that deep-cleaning my bathroom would leave me with knotted back muscles and sore muscles and fatigue for a week, whereas now I can deep clean the entire house and play Beat Saber for 2 hours afterward and only have mild fatigue and soreness for a couple of days.

I test once in the morning and 2 hours post dinner.  Found that there are certain things I can actually eat (like a little bit of pasta or potatoes) and things I certainly cannot eat at all (like pizza).  Dropped 15 lbs.

## Comment 
> This sub has been very helpful as I began with Keto. I also enjoy seeing people's tips and stories- both struggles and success. So I thought I'd share mine with the community!

I'm 35 and 6'3"". I've been morbidly obese for a long time. 6 or 7 years ago I was 490 pounds and eating myself to death. Slowly, over many years, with small changes I lost some weight.

Three months ago at 430 pounds I got a Diabetes diagnosis- and had likely been undiagnosed for at least a couple years. I had an A1C of 12.5, high blood pressure, and high LDL cholesterol (&gt;200).

I took this seriously, and decided to overhaul my diet entierly and embrace the low-carb/Keto lifestyle. Enter Keto (in addition to walking more and medications like Metformin and Ozempic):

At my 3 month appointment today I weighed in at 378 (down around 110 pounds total)! My A1C was 6.3. My LDL was 100. My Blood pressure was 118/76.

So in 3 months while on Keto I'm down 50 pounds, halved my A1C, halved my LDL cholesterol, and have my blood pressure under control!

Keto has been great for me. I credit a lot of my success in dropping not only weight and A1C, but also my bad cholesterol and BP, to keeping  what I consider almost a ""Mediterranean"" version of Keto.

Here's my approach/tips:

I eat at a deficit and track my calories and macros. Doing this, in addition to weighing portions, is important in my book- especially when first getting acclimated. You can probably eyeball it as you get it down, but it still makes me feel engaged and invested in the process!

I do intermittent fasting. I don't keep strict times, but I don't usually eat til I'm hungry or it's midday and I know I should eat something. I usually fast about 16 hours, give or take. Sometimes I do OMAD (one meal a day), with a small snack. Sometimes I eat three meals. It varies and I like that!

I have a tendency to binge, stress eat, and eat out of boredom. Know your triggers and work though them. Try to listen to your body and respect fullness. Keto helps keep me satiated and more able to recognize this feeling.

Getting adapted and seeing progress can take time. I had the traditional ""honeymoon"" drop of water weight, then hit the expected ""plateau"" that follows as my body adjusted. It did feel disheartening- but trust the process and keep going! About 3 weeks passed with little change, then it started to drop quickly again.

I use my fat macros as a cap, not a goal.

I try to use ""healthier"" fats like olive oil instead of butter and ghee when I can.

I prefer leaner cuts of meat and fish for the every day, and treat fattier portions and red meat like treats (yum)! My Friday night/ weekend feast is usually a bun-less burger or chicken wings.

I use egg whites to supplement (and cut down) on my egg yolk consumption (which is still relatively high)!

Spices are life. Spiced Greek yogurt (I like Fage) is a great companion to many foods.

Protein shakes are great and sub for a meal while keeping me full and tackling my sweet tooth- I usually make mine chocolate peanut butter- with a cup of spinach, a scoop of chocolate beef collagen protein powder, a Tbs of sugar-free PB2, some ice, a cup of coconut milk, and some vanilla extract. [My protein powder of choice.](https://activestacks.com/products/active-stacks-beef-boost-protein-powder-chocolate)

Finally, at first when I became more active on Keto I thought all the hubbub around electrolyte supplements was over-hyped. Enter persistent half-clenched cramping in my legs and thighs mid-walks that lasted for 30 minutes+. Be prepared and supplement your electrolytes! I really like [This flavored version.](https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Vitals-Electrolyte-Electrolytes-Supplement/dp/B07JXRGFPG/ref=rvi_sccl_2/146-2104855-9116660?pd_rd_w=DQ8UU&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.f5690a4d-f2bb-45d9-9d1b-736fee412437&amp;pf_rd_p=f5690a4d-f2bb-45d9-9d1b-736fee412437&amp;pf_rd_r=5MVM1WAZQNDTZCV8M7S5&amp;pd_rd_wg=arRde&amp;pd_rd_r=a60039aa-f3fe-479a-ada5-eb16dc55ac0d&amp;pd_rd_i=B07JXRGFPG&amp;psc=1) Fixed me right up.

Anyways, thanks for reading! I've still got around 100 pounds left till my goal weight, but the process is now running smooth and I feel encouraged being about halfway there!

Me: 43 year old male sex person, 6' tall, usually in the 250# range (last time I checked I was in the high 240's.) Carry my weight/fat heavily in my stomach area.  


T2 diabetic, diagnosed maybe 7 years ago now.  When I was diagnosed I weighed 335# roughly. I have maintained at my current weight range for 4-5 years.

Blood sugar is generally out of control to the point where I don't even check it anymore (my doctor knows this.) I take Basaglar insulin once a day, plus Ozempic once a week. I also take close to the max dose of Metformin daisly (1000mg twice a day.) I take two medications to control foot pain (Gabapentin max dose, Meloxicam.)

I am not entirely sedentary but I don't put forth a ton of exercize. ""Walking"" doesn't really cut it, I walk constantly anyway. I have been clinically diagnosed with generalized binge eating disorder.

I don't have a ton of money and can commit about $350 a month to groceries. I love pretty much all frutis and veg. I like cooked shrimp (like cocktail shrimp essentially,) but that's about the only seafood I really like. I like chicken in almost any form. I tend to only like ground beef, and I eat almost no pork. Ethnically speaking I can't think of a single type of food I don't enjoy.

I feel like if someone literally just set down a meal plan in front of me and said ""Do this for a month and add moderate exercize and you will shed pounds,"" I would have NO problem sticking to the meal plan. I know it seems stupid but when I'm told exactly what to do (particularly if it's low effort) I can do it!

Obviously because of the 'beetus I need something reasonably low carb, but I also don't want to do something stupid and drop my caloric intake to an absurd level  


That's the situation in a nutshell. I know it's a big ask to ask strangers to help with something like this but I'm feeling both motivated and deeply anxious; stuck, yet open to being unstuck.  


So urm...take it away, Reddit!

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now.

Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see.

I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up.

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it.

Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up.

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it.

Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time.

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> This year I hit 485 and went to my doctor to get blood work done. I am now diabetic and working my ass off to get back into a healthy HBA1C range. I started a medically supervised diet on 10/26. This morning I weighed 429. 55 pounds in 5.5 weeks gone! I'm also on Metformin and Ozempic, and I believe they're helping a ton. I'd talk to your doctor about appropriate weight loss plans for you.

## Comment 
> Maybe you are me? Ok, I am 11 years older and weigh 241 lbs right now. So you are in a much better place. But our story has lots of similarities, I find. 

Overweight teenage time, plunge into anorexia, stopping that but instead starting to party a lot (raves, dancing, you know), experiencing a blissful time without weight problems (but with other problems, I guess) then slowly starting to go up in weight in my late 20s, starting to develop serious health issues (mine was IR then). Ballooning up to 242 lbs in my late 30s (after second child). Working my way all the way down with cico and exercise between 2015 and 2017. Went from 242 to 172. Ruining all my efforts with having a third child and letting myself go during covid. Leveling up the IR to serious T2D. Ballooning up again to 255. Somehow running against a wall with losing weight while I'm still breastfeeding (hormonal? broken sleep pattern? psychological problem?) and having bad glucose numbers (feeling low energy all the time). Stopped breastfeeding in August. Lost 7 lbs between August, 13 and November, 13 with eating less junk and smaller portions. Then was started on ozempic due to my diabetes issues getting worse. Lost another 7 lbs this last months on ozempic. 

Here I am again in this sub. It's been a while. Let's do this together.

> Why don't you go to a grocery store that has a huge produce section and browse, try to pick a veggie or fruit to try...something outside the usual carrots, celery, and cucumbers. Pick a new thing once a week and try it. You might find your new favorite food. And don't be afraid of anything you never heard of, there is always YouTube to figure out how to prepare it.  

I I completely understand the oreo binging. I used to say I did lines of oreos, because I was addicted.  I wound up diabetic,  but, I did get placed on a med that quieted those thoughts.(even though my diagnosis and being put on the medication was years apart)I haven't wanted an oreo in months. It helped me so much and I finally lost weight....I was 257, I'm now 181. Started the med in July.  If you are diabetic,  it's called Mounjaro,  it works on 2 hunger hormones and calms them down. It makes your mind be food quiet. My blood sugar numbers are amazing,  it even lowered my blood pressure,  it wasn't high, but I know insurance considers 120/80 like borderline know....120/80 used to be considered perfect and what I always was. It's now 110 can't remember that bottom number. That med is really my only advice as someone who used to binge. It's been the only thing that helped my binging.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

> With your BMI you should talk to your doctor about if your insurance covers GLP-1s like Wegovy. I struggled doing everything “perfect” for years with very little results until I started this stuff and it’s regulated it all. Down 30lbs since October.

## Comment 
> Hi I am new, so I'll introduce myself:

F45 / 170cm / SW 116kg / CW 109,9kg / GW 80kg

I am German and live in Berlin. I have PCOS, IR and now t2d. 

I have 3 kids, 8 years apart. The first one I had in my twenties and bounced back quickly. The second one I had in my 30s and found myself gaining weight even after the pregnancy. Found out I was developing IR. Went on metformin, put in a lot of effort and lost 36 kg (from 114 to 78) between 2015 and 2017. The third one I had in my 40s, 3 years ago actually. This time I gained weight excessively while being pregnant and continued to afterwards. I found out I was in t2d land in 2020 and lost about 10kg, but then covid happened and I had ppd or just depression, who knows. I had a 9 yo to homeschooling and a 1 yo to watch and nowhere to go, no one to meet and it was just too much. So I ate myself back up. Again I tried losing in 2021, lost 5kg and fell off the bandwagon. In August I finally weaned the youngest and suddenly I was able to lose some weight. I lost 3 kg between August and November. Not very much, but still least a beginning. But my diabetes numbers got worse with every check up and my doctor wasn't happy. She put me on ozempic. I've been on it for 4,5 weeks now and lost another 3 kg. So I'm down about 6 kg now. 

I'm actually losing without doing much at the moment, but I want to slowly establish more healthy habits. Because even with this medication I will eventually hit a plateau and I am reading of people starting to gain later on in the journey. And also, I guess it's just time. 

So, I have hardly done any exercise in the past 4 years roundabout. I currently have a heel spur that's bothering me. My task last week was to make an appointment with an orthopedic. This week I was to attend it, which I did exactly yesterday. My next task is to make a realistic plan how a first workout could look like and what I need to do it. 

My plan is to start using the lose it app for more than just weight surveillance. I entered all my food today and I also pre-entered the food for snack and dinner. So maybe this will be a good first day to stay in my calory allowance. I am hopeful. However, I also know myself and I am in the week leading up to my period and I might need something sweet later on. I will see. Plan is to keep track regardless of staying within the allowance or not. Just to build the habit of entering the food and staying accountable.

## Comment 
> Prior to taking semaglutide, my satiety feedback loop was badly broken and I was prone to mindlessly shoveling food without any real rhyme or reason. I’m still titrating up to the full dose, but even after two months I’ve already lost almost twenty pounds, and when I think about food now, I can actually listen to my body tell me when I’m not genuinely hungry. It’s given me back all this self-control and willpower that I’d lost over the years. Powerful stuff. Instead of reflexively clearing my plate, I just eat till I feel like I’ve had enough.

## Comment 
> I’ve lost about 40 pounds, but this really has to do with the Ozempic. I am thinking about doing the Masters program but haven’t decided yet. Ultimately, the drugs work. Calibrate pushed several appeals through on my behalf to get the prescription approved, however from what other posters have said, it sounds like their ability to do this has been reduced as the number of clients increased. If your doctor will prescribe the meds, I’d go through them first with the PA process. For reference, my husband went to his doctor and got a prescription but our insurance denied his PA request. It all feels overly complicated, but I am happy with the results. Only time will tell if I can maintain without the meds.

## Comment 
> I’m having a similar experience, it’s been such a positive change for me! I’m down about 20lbs in 10 weeks, with minimal side effects. I think those who have more noticeable side effects lose a bit faster, but I’m happy with the rate I’m losing. I’ve actually got a post that I update each week where I share my experience, here’s the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/om7l5z/my_experience_with_semaglutide_so_far/

## Comment 
> My experience is that I have been but I'm learning that every person is different. I'm in discussions with my Doc to see if I need stop at my current 1.0mg does as it is effective.  I get pretty nauseous and may not need to jump to a higher dose.

Gastric Bypass folks tend to  metabolize things a bit differently.  For example, I can a have beer or a shot and will nearly instantly feel drunk (lightheaded, animated etc). But I sober up within 30 minutes like I've never had a drink. My friends think this is bizarre. They are still tipsy for much longer. I suspect if we had breathalyzer tests, they would blow a much higher blood alcohol level than me. I'd still register  but would be significantly less then them. ( We actually did this test! A bar had a breathalyzer!!)

I think this might be the same with Wegovy. It settles where we metabolize things.

Best advice - trust wegovy and your docs. Up the dose when appropriate.  Your best and effective dose may be different from mine.

## Comment 
> I First was in victoza, lost half of the weight I needed, then stalled so switched to ozempic. Now I am at maintenance and dialed back one click on the pen so I stopped losing weight . After a few weeks I have gained back three pounds and my appetite is coming back. It seems that these GLP drugs are not a long term solution, and I will have to keep raising the dose to maintain appetite suppression and weight maintenance. When I get to the highest dose of ozempic I will be screwed because I will slowly gain back the weight it seems. Unless I can then switch back to victoza and continue maintenance, and just keep switching back and forth from ozempic to victoza to maintain. Thoughts ?

As for “when to inject” - I was told it doesn’t matter if it’s morning or evening, as long as it’s once a week as indicated.

I do notice one other thing though. Some days I'm very fatigued. Not sure if it's the medicine or not eating enough.  I've been trying to make sure I eat enough nutritious foods but some days that's a challenge. Otherwise very happy with it. I've lost 12 pounds and have pushed past a plateau. Good luck!

What really stood out to me today as I was looking at all the stats from the scale is that I have less than 100# to reach my goal weight. That’s just …amazing! 

I am amazed. That seems attainable now.

I'm currently losing at about 1.4%/week, so maybe I should slow that down a little (although it's hard to want to slow down the weight loss!), but you're probably right.  Thank you.

## Comment 
> I am having to pay out of pocket as insurance in Canada doesn’t cover the drug which is rough. Thankfully ozempic is only $242 a month no matter the dosage. I will raise chest tightness when I see the doctor next week. I should also mention I was put on metformin as well which gives me constant headaches. I mentioned the headaches and that was the reason behind the higher ozempic dosage so I can get off metformin. I have changed my diet to accommodate blood sugars so this has a lot to do with my weight loss but ozempic makes it almost impossible to eat so anytime I do eat I find myself always choosing healthier options. I have lost about 16% of my body weight in 10 weeks and I hope to lose another 14% so diabetes goes into remission.

I’ve lost almost 40lbs in under 6 months, about 15% of my starting body weight, so I think it’s clear the medication is working for me. I wonder how strict they are about documented weight loss, since all of my doctor visits have been via telehealth, so my weights are self reported. I hope that won’t be an issue.

Considering you have to be in obese territory to be prescribed, it just got FDA approval in June, and it takes 3 full months to get to the right dose for most, I just don't think there are many people who have hit their goals yet. I started in August and I've lost 22 lbs so far but I still have another 37 to go before goal.

> After 2 months on Ozembic, I am suffering some uncharacteristic muscle strains. Not sure if that corresponds with muscle loss, or the dehydration and muscle cramping I am experiencing.  I lost 5 lbs in 1 week. I was prescribed the medicine for type 2 diabetes not weight loss.

Since June 2 I am down 19 lbs but just went up to 1mg per week last week. So will going through pens faster now and looking for most economical place to find it.  Thanks again and continue success in your weight loss.

Total weight lost 70lbs. 

so far I have regained 30. So total 40lbs. 

I am going to start it back up and see what happens. The weight gain was quicker than I originally thought. The appetite comes back rather quick when off. 

Anyone else have a similar experience?

What I found interesting was that over the competition of other drugs Semaglutide gives the best bang for the buck and you'll probably lose more weight with Ozempic / Wegovy than any of the other offerings in the market place..

I'm doing Ozempic and slowly moving up in doses. I'm down 5lbs in weight since starting 3 weeks ago.

I started metformin first, and then wegovy about 2 weeks later.  Noticed decreased appetite with metformin. Very pleased so far, I have not weighed 185 in 15 years.  It's definitely working for me.

## Comment 
> That's a great idea. Hopefully I never have to remember to do it! My habits are definitely changing, but Im working on making them as conscious and deliverate as I can, because over time my gasteic side effects have subsided and although semaglutide still helps a LOT, it no longer does all the work for me, as it did for the first couple of months.

But then Im on Ozempic, and perhaps for folks who are able to continue to the higher doses they can benefit from the automatic aspect for longer? Ive just now levelled up to 1 mg. I titrated as slowly as possible because I knew this was my max dose. Ive lost 30 pounds, which was about 13% of my starting weight, but I have another 30 to lose to get to my goal, which is to be merely ""overweight"" - so it's not a vanity target, and Im very motivated to reach it, so I can live the active lifestyle I want.

> I normally only weigh myself once a week or so. But I listened to a presenter who said to get on the scale every day. If you don’t know the truth then you can’t face it. I’ve lost 2 pounds since starting semaglutide last Friday. So now I do the happy dance every morning. Not sure how I’ll react if I stay the same or gained. Any thoughts on how I should handle that?

I’ve had no issue with effectiveness waning, and have lost about 12% so far

## Comment 
> Thank you!!! I think my BMR (basal metabolic rate) is relatively high because my intake was like 4,000+ calories (yikes) and I maintained at 240 lb for years. Now I’m eating 1200-1500 calories per day but I also went from no exercise to burning like 500+ calories per day with exercise. So as you can see, I am creating quite the calorie deficit. However, as I lose weight I realize it will slow down a lot because my BMR will also decrease. 🥳

SW: 312.8lbs (141.9 kg) after 13 weeks I am under 250lbs (113 kg).

i guarantee there are people larger than me at there starting and even have been on the drug longer. We all have different journeys, so be of good cheer for your amazing loss so far.

## Comment 
> Woah, read in it in the comments that you lost about 12 kg!! That is a steady 1 kilo a week. Well done! Next time you visit the grocary store, check those kilo pacages of sugar or flour. 12 of those, thats insane!! You lost more then 10% of your body weight!!! A tenth, of you, is gone, goodbyeeeee. 

First time i was on this page I read about people that wanted to lose that 'stobburn belly' or 'love handles' and got Semaglutide because of it while having a healthy weight. Couldnt believe what I was reading. Here I am, being  obese for almost my entire life. Just before I got diagnosed with diabetics disease I had a short periode where I was fine with my body type. Realised I wasnt that healthy as I thought. 

My heaviest was 106kg. My start weight on ozempic was 99.5. Now I'm 96.0. I really hope, really really really hope that my weight loss will be as well as yours is going.

## Comment 
> Yep I get that too! Here's some more somewhat larger numbers from me:

Starting weight 321 lbs (145.6 kg)
Current weight 264 lbs (119.7 kg)

I've only been on Ozempic for 5 - 6 weeks as of now, but working on my weight loss for 11 months. 57 pounds is not nearly as much as I wanted to lose in a year but it's been stable for me for the first time ever so I'm really happy with where I am and where I'm headed ^_^

Keep it up, you got this!

## Comment 
> It’s easy to say don’t be disheartened but many of us have been there. I must have started and stopped at least 20 times. Every time I stopped I gained the weight back and more. I was really ready to just give up. I had 70 pounds to lose and I would sabotage myself over and over again. This time I realized that I was either going to continue to gain weight or I was going to make the decision to lose weight no matter how long it took me. Semaglutide has really helped to curb my appetite. I’m very careful that I eat low-carb even if I snack. Intermittent fasting for 16 hours and no eating after 5 o’clock has really helped. I weighed myself every day and sometimes there’s just small victories like .2 or .4 pounds loss and sometimes it’s even more than that.
Little by little I have lost 19 pounds – and I keep saying to myself if I hadn’t done this I would probably have gained 10 pounds. So start where you are and look forward to a little bit every day until someday you reach your goal.
Don’t compare yourself with everyone else. Be kinder to yourself

I am about to turn 50 with a long history of weight struggles along with hypertension, high cholesterol. I started at 206, 5ft 1. I am now at 142 and all my weight related conditions have completely turned around. Have hope, I think this is a wonder drug! I second drinking lots of water, and aim to get plenty of protein each day as well, it really helps. Good luck!

I have noticed a significant drop when I maintain or increase my water intake above 3 litres per day. If for whatever reason my water intake drops I tend to plateau. I have tried google but no luck. 
Hope y’all can provide some insight.
For reference I had my 4th shot on Thursday just gone, I am down a total of 4.8 kilos, 2.7 kilos in the last week

## Comment 
> Noticed that the second day (mostly also the third) is the day that my eating habbits change the most. I crave fresh fruit and veggies, but only like, tough ones. Like cucumbers and paprika, no sloppy tomatoes. 

Just woke up on my second day, growling of hunger. Ok, ok, egg sandwich: 2 eggs, 2 whole weat slices of bread, bit of cheese, cucumber. Good, right? No. Almost half way trough I felt sick to my stomic, nausia. Left it in the fridge, still kinda hungry, but also not able to eat any  further. 

Im still  weirded out by this miracle drug. Its my day off and nobodies home, before semaglutide I would empty the pantry. Spaghetti for breakfast! Buttery eggs on avocado toast for a snack! Groceries for lunch would be a big of crisps with creamcheese and a romaine salad. More carbs, salt, fat, gooey goodness.  Almost all of that behaviour is gone, 6th-7th day it comes back a little but after a few weeks the drive to lose weight set in, seeing results on the scale and thanksto some old clothes that fit easier again. 

F/31, CW: 92,7kg. SW: 99,5kg, GW: if i will ever hit 80kg i will cry. 8 weeks in the program. Diabetes type 2. 

TLDR: What do you snack when hungry but no appatite?

I haven’t changed my eating from low carb and intermittent fasting. Plenty of water. But I will stick to it because my glucose readings and other bloodwork is showing great improvement

> Welcome! I am fascinated with this med and what it’s doing for people even though I stopped several months ago. I lost my weight as quickly as it came on. 40 pounds in a few months. I am an engineer so have a lot of data about calories and weight before, during, and after the drug and the numbers don’t add up. It’s doing a lot more that reduce appetite for some of us but not others! I wish I was a biochemist so the studies on GLP-1 agonists would be less painful to read! My daughter starts up a biochem program in the fall so hopefully she can decipher things someday but it will be awhile! 

Good luck! I hope it works for you. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. And if you see any cool research send it my way:)

## Comment 
> I dunno... I started with 0.25 and was quite good in one month, then we increased the dosage to 0.5 mg a week and after two months I had lost about 10 pounds ... we increased the dosage again to 1mg but my weight hit a platteau: I am hungry again, weight creeped back about 6 pounds.But I give it: the A1C went down quite a lot and has stayed down.Interesting also to note is that some days, I am quite uninstered in food, like, I have a light breakfast just to push down some pills and don't feel any hunger until late in the afternoon....

Other times, just a lil amount of food at lunch will do for the day...

Basically..... sorry to say like may say, it's highly variable and keep in mind this stuff is for A1C/glucose control, not weight loss, which is just an added benefit for many but not for all I'm afraid.....

## Comment 
> I have the exact same dilemma. I'll be out of the country for 11 days and was wondering what to do. But was kind of forced to go through it a few weeks ago and it wasn't that bad. My doctor scheduled my follow up visit on the same day as my injection day, on the day I would be out. He wouldn't refill the prescription until he saw me. He called it in at the appointment and I should have been good to go. This was 7 days since my last injection so all I had to do was go pick it up from the pharmacy. But it was a huge mess with the insurance. I had to fight with them for the next week to get them to fill it. So in total, I went 15 days without an injection. But surprisingly my appetite didn't seem to return by to much. I was able to eat a little heavier than usual without getting too full, but the cravings didn't return. I actually lost 2 pounds during the extra week without it. So I'm not even worried about doing two weeks without a shot. It will be kinda nice to just enjoy my vacation without the side effects, and be able to eat a little less cautiously. Don't worry, you'll be fine

## Comment 
> I was prescribed semaglutide for diabetes and metformin (1000mg) for PCOS in August 2021. Since then, I have lost 65lbs and my A1c went from nearly 12 to 5.7 (which is now “pre diabetic” and just 1/10th of a point away from “normal”).

The thing is that I was on the same amount of metformin for years…and all sorts of different diets but I couldn’t lose weight and my A1c barely ever improved. I am 100% convinced that this enormous progress I am experiencing is mostly attributed to semaglutide, in conjunction with metformin. My PCP wants me to get blood work in a month, and if I’m back in the normal A1c range, he will decrease my metformin script.

If your doctor suggests you take both, give it a good try. Both scripts working together have truly changed my health for the better.

I don’t have a lot of advice on how to get it cheaply except to say except that some send the script to Mark’s Marine Pharmacy in Canada and have it shipped. Supposed to be better than prices in the US. Good luck, it is a great drug!!

Now I just need to get my insurance to reauthorize, as my initial preauthorization was until June 2022. I’ve lost almost 22% since starting semaglutide last July, but the first 5 months were on Ozempic, so since starting WeGovy in December, I’ve lost about 10%. Not sure if that will matter.

## Comment 
> I would try eating smaller portions through out the day. Like maybe half a sandwich a few times a day. There are days I feel full after only a couple bites of a sandwich but if I stop And don’t eat the whole thing my stomach feels better and a few hours later I might want a couple more bites. I don’t force myself to eat and I stop as soon as I feel full so I don’t feel sick. I eventually eat it, its just spread out. Also if you eating tuna salad sandwiches I would stop. I have more gastrointestinal effects when I eat food with too much fat and/or sugar. Honestly if I eat a meal with too much protein I feel sick too. I think its because my body takes so long to process it and its such a heavy food. So to make up for me not eating as much protein. I supplement with protein powder on weight lifting days. I am down 34lbs.

## Comment 
> That sounds like ADHD.  Do you leave boxes laying around (full of shit)  that you keep telling yourself to put away but you never get around to doing it because you always feel overwhelmed with doing just the smallest tasks? 🤣  That is me.  Your behavior/symptoms sound exactly like that of someone with ADHD.  Go get evaluated.  Women are underdiagnosed.  My son was diagnosed when he was 6.  Since then, we have done a lot of therapy for coping skills and med adjustments.  It has done him wonders.  But through this process, I have realized that even though we (me and my son) present differently....we are very much alike.  Worth looking into.  Could change your life.  

And yes.  When you are big...people do not see you.  They look away.  I have never felt more alone in this world.  I had a great fit body until about 2014.  That's when my weight gain began.  People used to hold doors for me and look at me as I walked by.  Then it turned into nobody holding a door or looking at me (atleast without looking away quickly).  I lost every bit of confidence which made things worse.  It's sad.  People really do treat you much differently when you are big.  I've been both. And becoming obese has beaten me down.  

  I am slowly seeing some confidence come back as the weight comes off.  I've lost 23 lbs since April.  I am 5'2 and currently 192.  But at my biggest, I was 250.  I lost an incredible amount of weight last year from abstaining from alcohol.  Haven't had a drop of alcohol since Christmas 2020.  Couldn't shake the rest of the weight off so I started rybelsus.

> I actually started incorporating Fairlife shakes into my diet about a year before starting Ozempic. I was looking into gastric sleeve surgery at that time. I lost 30lbs just by replacing one to two meals a day with a shake plus a small “chewable” food. Like a salad or some cheese and crackers. I’ve continued using them while on Ozempic and have lost another 20lbs so far (in almost 3 months.) All that to say, highly recommend finding a shake you enjoy and adding it into your diet!

Definitely take your time with it and dramatically decrease amount until you know how your body handles it. I also do that any time I increase my dose. Good luck!

I'm also middle-aged, also have herniated discs, get epidurals for pain but my back has been remarkably pain free since losing 40 lbs on Ozempic. Yoga and swimming are both fantastic. But the appointments with the trainer are key to consistency!

## Comment 
> I hate to say it but not great. I have gained 7 lbs maybe 10 but I think I have leveled off. Those 7 came on quick but I have been ok lately.  It really hard work . I am really focusing on measuring my food and keeping track of calories and protein. All the food love is back as are my snacking tendencies. Lol but I’m battling it and have been ok last few weeks and not gaining. I am going on Mounjaro to get these 7 back off and lose the last 10 I wanted to originally but I am trying to remain positive that I will keep this off all my own without medication later but I’m also scared that I won’t. All I can do is keep on trying. I don’t let one bad day turn into a bad week. I need to get back to weighing myself each morning. That is the one habit I stopped but it just started becoming too depressing.

## Comment 
> I’m not following any kind of diet or plan and I don’t track, really. But I have been making more conscious decisions like ensuring I have more fruits and veggies and cooking or prepping more food in bulk/in advance to make it easier. I have found for sure that my cravings for sweets has been greatly reduced so it’s easy to forgo a lot of the sugary things I was eating before. And when I do want something, I’m satisfied with much less than before. 

Edited to add: my loss has been slow and steady - I lost about 20lbs/10% of my weight over the last 6 months. I know a lot of other people lose more quickly if they make more dietary changes but I want to do this in a way that is realistic and sustainable for me. Cutting out entire food groups or calorie counting just isn’t sustainable for me and I do NOT want this to be a yo-yo situation. I’m trying to eat in a way that feels reasonable and also making tiny changes that I’ll actually be able to stick with.

The first two drs that denied me didn’t seem the least bit concerned. Not even my psychiatrist smh. After being on ozempic since April, I have lost 25 pounds and finally starting to feel more like myself again.

## Comment 
> I won’t argue against appetite suppression being a key element of the weight loss associated with semaglutide, but that’s not it for me. I’ve been on adderall for years which suppresses my appetite far more than Ozempic has, and I didn’t lose a pound. I tried to diligently track calories, thinking maybe I was somehow eating way too much when the meds wore off, but nope. 

Within a week of starting Ozempic, I had lost six pounds, with zero changes to my eating habits or lifestyle. It seems clear to me that there’s more at play here than appetite suppression. The changes to insulin/glucagon can have effects beyond just decreasing appetite. There’s still so much we don’t know about how our bodies work and even how or why different drugs affect us the way they do. Scientists have a lot of theories and other people like to repeat those theories as cold hard fact so that they can dismiss others’ experiences.

## Comment 
> I went on vacation for 2 weeks recently. I did take my shot before leaving. For the second week I was unmedicated in theory, but my appetite barely returned. I don’t know enough about the drug to come up with a plausible theory about how thats possible. More importantly, I consciously decided to take a break from dieting during the second week and ate whatever I wanted and somehow lost 3 more pounds. I was eating less than normal because my appetite hadn’t returned, but I’m still shocked that I lost that much in one week without consciously dieting. To put it in perspective, I have never in my life lost that much in one week even while dieting hard before I started taking this drug. I should probably point out that I’m a short woman, so 3 pounds is a lot.

## Comment 
> It took a few weeks to start working for me, but I'm on it since April and have lost 10% of my starting weight. Very happy with the results so far. My hunger used to drive me crazy even when I wasn't dieting. My whole day revolved around food. When I went out to eat I was always choosing the item on the menu with the most food even if it wasn't what I wanted. Now I don't think about food all the time and can really enjoy what I do eat. I feel more ""normal"", as in this is how people who don't struggle with their weight feel.

Best of luck with your journey, I hope it helps you!

## Comment 
> I’ve lost 50 pounds with Wegovy/ Saxenda, and 70 total. With being on Wegovy I’ve lost muscle mass, because I can’t carry as heavy things. Another medication I take, currently I have a side effect I didn’t before because my meds are different with less weight on my body. I’ve had to buy a whole new wardrobe. It was exciting picking out a swimsuit right off the rack. I’ve enjoyed the results!!!

> It can happen. https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/telogen-effluvium-and-diet  Happened to me twice because of shock/dramatic change to my body. Once when I was in the hospital , very very sick for 2 weeks. And again with Ozempic- I’ve lost 85lbs and am now on a  maintenance dose. 

Doctor checked my numbers for nutrition issues but all was good. Luckily, I have lots of thick hair to start with so only I really noticed it but man, the amount of hair on my brush and in the shower! Felt like it  lasted a couple of months. 

Added biotin at my docs Rec to encourage faster regrowth. Seems to have tapered off now.

I am a 53 year old male, 6'3"" with my highest  weight of 405 lbs.  I made an appointment with the local University's weight loss program but couldn't get in for a few months.  I was thinkging about bariatric surgery with a goal then of 295 lbs. . .I hit that this week after 45 weeks on Ozempic.  

Needless to say, I've changed my goal weights:  388 by October 23rd. . .that would be 100lbs in a year on Ozempic.  Then 275 by January 1. . .i was 275lbs 26 years ago when I got married.  I'll decide when I hit 275 what my next milestone will be.

**Keep up the great work!**

I was wondering what others are doing once they reach their weight goal? Maintenance dosage? Stopping it all together?

Anyone have any personal experience or insight from their doctor. I haven’t found published medical literature about this.

I’m eating “normal” foods (aka normal to me, stuff that’s accessible and not too complicated) in smaller portions. I have reduced sugar but not totally cut it out, and avoid fried foods except in small amounts. I try to get enough protein and vegetables, but I don’t stress it. I’ve lost 60 lbs in about 9 months.

> Yeah that's okay. Make the best out of it by cutting down on junk food and drinking less soda. You'll feel tired lots of the time if you don't eat through the day. Exercise as well is a very good plus :) been on 1mg for 2 months now, 4 overall on Ozempic, 18kg lost, 10 to go! 

Godspeed

Down 6.2lbs in nine days. 
Day 2 after the shot seems to be the worst for nausea. 
I’m averaging 700 calories a day, which is way too low, and also the reason I’m not working out. 
But I’m in it to win it. 🤜🏻🤛🏻

I lost 4lbs the first week, 2 lbs the next. And since then it’s been about 1 pound a week or less. My endocrinologist suspects my severe anemia is halting the weight loss now. I hope it picks back up after I get my iron infusions. I am currently on 1.0 dose a week. My main bothersome side effect is fatigue certain weeks and reflux with trigger foods. Nothing severe.

Essentially, Dr was very aggressive in the initial dosage. I took my first dose on Tuesday night and didn't stop vomiting from Wednesday to Saturday night. 

I spent my lovely Saturday evening and into the wee hours of Sunday morning doubled over in pain at the ER.  I am noe on stomach pain meds, anti nausea meds and don't want to eat bc I'm afraid I'm going to relapse. 

I haven't eaten much more than dry toast since Wednesday. 

Needless to say, i will not continue with this med. I lost 10lbs in 5 days though, so there's that.

## Comment 
> A better understanding of the studies that support the efficacy of semaglutide and what those numbers actually are. The idea of “significant” weight loss, and the amount of time it will take,  from a lay persons perspective vs what the data has shown are completely different. I’ve been on it for 8 months and I’ve lost 11%. I was very disappointed until I looked at the actual study that showed an average weight loss of 10-15 percent of body weight over the course of 18 months. So I’ve been fortunate and lost more than thr study average. Perhaps having those numbers right up front would help manage expectations.

Aside from similar but maybe slightly less constipation, I’ve had no side effects from MJ which has been incredible. I’m on my 3rd week of 5mg and am down about ~7% of my body weight so far from my highest weight pre-Ozempic.

I’ve lost 17lbs in five weeks, but it’s come with nausea, upset stomach, and constipation. While I don’t enjoy those symptoms, the results are worth it. If it makes you too sick then stop taking it. Or you might be in the group of people that have no bad side effects. You won’t know till you start.

I’m happier because I’m in control of my food intake. I was like a bottomless pit when it came to food. I still love food, I just eat a lot less of it and I’m not thinking about it all the time. Just give it a try. It will change your life 💗

It definitely makes you eat less. But I think because it helps your body with using insulin, there are other mechanisms that assist with weight loss. I am now 10lb below my original goal weight, never could have done it otherwise.

## Comment 
> I averaged about 4.5 lbs/month the first 6 months. Since then, it's about 2.5 lbs a month. I'm now at month 10 and have lost 34 lbs total. Would I like more?  Sure, but the fact is, the scale is still going down and my clothes fit better.  And I'm 34 lbs lighter than I was when I started.   I hit a plateau for about 6 weeks where I kept going up and down the same pound, but that seems to have corrected itself in the last couple of weeks.  Point is, not everyone loses massive amounts of weight each month.  .5 - 2 lbs per week is healthy.  Don't be so discouraged and stop comparing yourself to others.

## Comment 
> I went on vacation for 2 weeks recently. I did take my shot before leaving. For the second week I was unmedicated in theory, but my appetite barely returned. I don’t know enough about the drug to come up with a plausible theory about how thats possible. More importantly, I consciously decided to take a break from dieting during the second week and ate whatever I wanted and somehow lost 3 more pounds. I was eating less than normal because my appetite hadn’t returned, but I’m still shocked that I lost that much in one week without consciously dieting. To put it in perspective, I have never in my life lost that much in one week even while dieting hard before I started taking this drug. I should probably point out that I’m a short woman, so 3 pounds is a lot.

She lost about 15 pounds just from the reduced hunger and other positive effects of Ozempic before the taste problems started. So for her, this is a definite negative. Thanks for your input.

I know it is easy to get discouraged, especially if you have been struggling with your weight for years. My advice would be to stick with it and see what your experience is at max dose.  Of course, always talk to your doctor if you have concerns.  

I started this medication in September 2021 and have lost 76 pounds so far. It has been a great tool to help me change my habits and how I see food. It isn't a magic bullet, but definitely a great tool to carry out lifestyle changes for me.

## Comment 
> Tl;dr version: I've stalled out after 65 lbs. weight lost and am looking for reasonably healthy suggestions for getting down further.  

Longer: My journey started about 2 years ago at 305 lbs. (5'11"", BMI 40+, 40ishM) and an A1c of 8.0. Through strength training for a year and a half, diet, and oral meds (Metformin &amp; Jardiance) I got it to 285-290 lbs. and 6.4 A1c.  I started Wegovy in April and got down to 240 lbs. and 5.3 A1c in August.  I've been able to drop Jardiance and look and feel better.  But the weight loss has stopped.  Some additional weight has probably shifted from fat to muscle.  

I'd like to get down another 20 lbs. so my BMI is merely ""overweight"" instead of obese.  My build (50"" chest, 42"" waist after losing 65 lbs.) will probably never let me be ""not overweight.""   But a sub-30 BMI would probably resolve at least some health problems (hyperlipidemia &amp; OSA).  

Any suggestions on getting through a months-long plateau?

## Comment 
> Hey everyone! I’ve been titrating up on Ozempic since Sept 15th. Most of this time has been spent feeling sick as hell. Nausea, stomach issues. Many of my favorite foods smelled disgusting etx. Down 22 pounds so I stayed committed. Even on a cruise 🤢 Suddenly this week…..I feel ok. I can eat. I’m actually hungry. Not sick at all.  Now I don’t know what to do lol. Will next week’s shot make me feel like hell again? Anyone experience this?

> I’m only an inch or 2 taller, and my highest was 365lbs.  Last Friday when I weighed I was down to 312lbs.  You can do this!

In my case meds have been a game changer!  At my worst I finally opened up to my Dr about my BED, and she prescribed Prozac.  It helped a lot, but when my Endo added Ozempic - prescribed for my diabetes - it’s been a world of difference!  I can actually eat like a normal person!

I also agree with someone else’s suggestion about taking up a hobby to keep your hands busy - I learned knitting and crochet.  I’ve also dabbled in drawing, painting and coloring books!

## Comment 
> Hi :) I'm older than you but 350 was my start weight. I started on Metformin and Ozempic in October last year and I'm now down to about 270. It was amazing how it helped with my eating. And my blood pressure is so much better and my blood glucose and insulin has come down. I'm feeling so much better :)  I'm hoping to lose another 70lbs or so and I'm focusing on one day at a time at the moment. Today I will eat well and exercise. 

Good luck to you :) there is an ozempic subreddit and a semaglutide subreddit with lots of commentary. Some helpful, some less so :) 

Take photos. I try and take a photo every weekend of my face and I have just done a collage of my starting out photo, the 10% loss and 20% loss photos. When I'm feeling discouraged about how far I have to go I look at how far I have come.

## Comment 
> I'm on mounjaro which is similar, and am a T2 diabetic.  I lost 20 lbs before starting mounjaro and 46 lbs since I started (I started mounjaro in July).  I've had little to no side effects, and it has very effectively treated my blood sugars as well.  I also do keto.  I've always eaten to when I'm satiated, and before I started mounjaro that was about 1600 calories and now I'm averaging 1200 calories, though my doctor is wanting me to up those especially on days that I swim (I started swimming in August), so I'm trying to up that.  Mounjaro makes me not hungry at all, and it makes me uninterested in food.  Which makes it really easy to stick to my eating plan!

## Comment 
> Hello All! I’m new to the group. I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life. In December I started taking ozempic and that helped a lot with appetite. I was so excited to start and was hoping to see numbers like ones in Facebook groups. But I didn’t see anything. I’m feeling discouraged because I stayed the same weight:

HW: 370
CW: 320
GW: 150 but I’d be happy at 160
Height: 5’2

My weight loss doctor had put in a prescription for Wegovy but my insurance doesn’t cover it and it’s $1,500 a month. For now, I’m going to stay on ozempic. My doctor thinks I’m insulin resistant which makes loosing weight harder.

She gave me macro numbers which I aim to stick to- 1900-2200 (ideally 1600) calories (higher end if I work out), 91 protein, 70 fat and 200g carbs. I also take metformin 2x a day.

I work out with a trainer 1-2x a week and do the elliptical 3x a week for 30 mins.

I’m feeling lost at the moment and feeling like weight loss surgery is the only option. I’m not sure what to do next. I have a follow up appointment in a few weeks and doing a body scan next week.

I’ve tried fasting, alternative day fasting (which helped and I got to 298 and then stalled then regained to 320), keto, low carb, etc

Any advice helps!

I started intermittent fasting and low carb/no added sugar a week before that and I am down 21 pounds in 3 weeks (I’m aware it was a lot of water weight haha). If you stick with that medicine and a solid diet or caloric restriction that works for you, you will absolutely lose weight. Good luck!!

Age and sex/gender : 34(M) No preference!

What’s the plan : I’ve been doing 20/4 intermittent fasting, under 60-100 carbs a day and nothing with added sugar. I am also on Ozempic for type 2 diabetes which also assists with weight loss.

What are your stats? : 5’9”, Starting weight 473 pounds, current weight 444, goal weight… honestly first goal is 200 as I know it will get incredibly harder after that. I haven’t been under 200 since maybe 10 years old so, that is a big deal for me!

What are you looking for? At least a weekly check in, share weight loss for that (I weigh daily but every Friday morning is my “current weight until the next Friday to avoid fluctuations) Encouragement both ways, and support if needed, I know it isn’t easy. Pictures of food occasionally to maybe give healthy ideas to the other (although I do use a pre made meal plan during the week so maybe not so exciting!).

A bit about yourself : I’ve been overweight since around age 5, and it’s only gotten worse. I was 330 by age 14 and since then I’ve stayed above that up to my highest May 31st, 473. I was diagnosed  with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver and high cholesterol that day. My doctor basically told me if I don’t change right now, there’s a decent chance I could not see 40. Terrifying. That day I started my diet and I have been doing very well! I have always been a bit of a foodie so this has been a serious change.

Would you rather be DM’d initially or reply to this thread on the post? Either!

> I'm on mounjaro, and I have been since the beginning of July.  I'm also a T2 diabetic, so I'm taking it to treat that as well as for weight loss.  I lost 20 lbs on keto before going on mounjaro, and then I've lost 45 lbs since then on mounjaro.

Honestly, I love mounjaro.  It's pretty amazing.  I was on Victoza before Mounjaro.  My morning blood sugars have gone from 140s to 110s, and my average calories per day (I eat until I'm full) went from 1700 to 1200.  In fact, my doctor hasn't put me on the max dose because she doesn't want me to eat any less than what I'm eating now.  Some people have some side effects, but honestly I haven't had any - it's been smooth sailing.  But that could be because I switched from Victoza and it's a similar medication.

I have a friend who is signing up for WLS, and his surgeon just put him on Mounjaro in hopes that he can lose 100 lbs in a year to get him ready for surgery.

edited to add:  I still eat keto, just realized that it made it sounds like I quit that.  :)

> I have PCOS. I was at 260lbs for a long time in college. After, I lived on my own and struggled w mental health issues and a death in the family. Got up to 323lbs. Went to therapy, got on psych meds, and recently started Mounjaro for my insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. I’m down to 299 and feeling great. Basically, I’m saying get a doctor you trust, and take care of your mental health too! You are worth fighting for and being healthy is part of that.

## Comment 
> Ozempic changed my life. I finally can now identify if I am hungry vs thirsty vs looking to fill an emotional hole.
It isn't easy. And I've ticked off my doctor for going slower than the weekly protocol. But I know me, and I can tell if I am ready for the next step up.

When the pandemic happened I was on Saxenda- it works also. For me - my reaction to Ozempic was more immediate.
Down 70 pounds since the beginning of 2020.

I've learned to crave real food before junk food- which is major accomplishment. I've also been able to identify if an emotional eating session is more about volume than a specific craving. (There are times I just want to keep shoveling food in, when that happens I'm better equipped to stay away from the party sized bag of chips #CountsAsASingleServingIfIFinishInOneSession
And have graduated to popcorn with herbs or hot sauce )

I have a question.  My BMI is around 50, T2 diabetes.  I started keto five months ago, lost 20 lbs, and then started mounjaro (I had been on Victoza for years previously, I had never lost weight on it).  I've currently lost a total of 45 lbs.  I want to avoid bariatric surgery if I can, but to be honest the amount I have to lose is daunting.  Both my parents had the surgery and lost weight, but have suffered with side effects in the years following.  I've had great luck so far with what I'm doing, I love keto and mounjaro is working great for my appetite and keeping my diabetes under control, my numbers are fantastic.  So I feel like I'm doing good - but I've read the statistics about weight loss when you don't do the surgery and they're pretty bleak.  I can stay on mounjaro long term to treat my diabetes, and I'm expecting to be low-carbing basically forever.  I guess I sort of want to know - is it possible without surgery for someone who has as much to lose as I do?

## Comment 
> I’m truly sorry for what you’re going through. I was in a similar situation last October. I was 267 (5’1”), couldn’t even walk from my driveway to the street without wanting to cry because of the pain in my legs. I was basically unable to walk without feeling like I was hiking up a steep mountain!  I quit participating in life because anytime I went anywhere all I could focus on was the aim in my legs. I had all the same issues as you and thought for sure I had PAD. I  had testing done and was shocked to find that I didn’t have it. I started watching what I ate, got on Ozempic (diabetes and weight loss), and witching a few months I lost 25 pounds AND the pain in my legs disappeared. One year and 75 pounds later,and I feel like my life has been given back to me!  

I understand how scary it is to deal with health challenges. The only things that have helped me over the years is prayer, staying positive, and leaning on my loved ones. I’m here if you ever want to talk or have questions about Ozempic (if that’s even something you’re interested in trying). I know of 2 other people who lost weight on it. One lost 55 pounds and the other 100 pounds. Hang in there! XX

## Comment 
> I’m on Ozempic and Vyvanse for ADHD. I started at 336 and I’m at 314 now 9 weeks in. Talking to my doctor it’s about more than controlling the impulse to eat, there are clearly other hormonal imbalances going on, like how my body processed sugar and the associated inflammation from handling that poorly. It crushed my sugar cravings, and I actually notice when I feel full and stop. Other inflammatory-related stuff, like arthritis, has also improved. My doctor thinks I also had lower levels of leptin, which is the hormone that’s released to signal fullness. 

I have done multiple stretches of diet and exercise and couldn’t seem to lose more than 10 lbs in 6 months. And I’d be starving. Continued progress and a managed appetite are actually motivating for me. 

It’s not an easy drug to take though. Lots of side effects. It’s not quite the silver bullet people hope for. There are Ozempic and Semaglutide groups on here. I suggest reading through.

> Insulin resistance is a real thing.  I lost 20 lbs on keto before starting mounjaro, a similar med to Ozempic, and let me tell you how great this med is.  I've lost 50 lbs since then (beginning of July) and I haven't been hungry.  Saying no to carbs is easy now, it's like I was fighting and struggling before and now it's super easy.  I'm a T2 diabetic and my A1C is great now as well.  I've also really upped my exercise as well.  I feel like I now have the brain of a regular weight person.

In my case meds have been a game changer!  At my worst I finally opened up to my Dr about my BED, and she prescribed Prozac.  It helped a lot, but when my Endo added Ozempic - prescribed for my diabetes - it’s been a world of difference!  I can actually eat like a normal person!

I also agree with someone else’s suggestion about taking up a hobby to keep your hands busy - I learned knitting and crochet.  I’ve also dabbled in drawing, painting and coloring books!

My year in a nutshell:

I started 2022 with COVID, miserable, and feeling defeated with hardly being able to walk from feeling so sick.  As I slowly came out of long COVID and realized my before well-controlled T2 diabetes was no longer so well controlled as a side effect of the prednisone I had to take because of my asthma flare up from the COVID, I decided things needed to change.  I started a new medication (mounjaro), keto, and got much more serious about my swimming.  Here are the results:

Weight lost:  82 lbs

Weight left to go:  not sure of my goal weight really, but would like to lose at least 100 lbs more

Gym achievement:  I have swam over 61 miles this year!

Biggest NSV:  My A1C went from over 8 (post COVID prednisone number) to 5.3!!

I have really enjoyed the camaraderie and support from this subreddit, it's nice to know there's other folks in this fight together.

## Comment 
> I made a huge post a few days ago about my whole story and how I now have the flu and it's taking me across the line into the 200s, but thanks to you guys I'm making peace with that now and celebrating the milestone.

Stats:  49F, SW387, CW299, GW Healthy feeling?

Modes of weight loss:  keto, mounjaro for my T2 diabetes, more swimming than is strictly sane

What got me started on my journey:  getting very sick from COVID last January and getting really high blood sugars from the prednisone I had to take from it.  For the first time I really felt how much my weight was impacting my body.  I started in May.

Celebrate with me!  The last time I was in the 200s was before I had my first child, and she's now driving.  :)

I was 340lbs last year and now I hover 296-297lbs depending on water weight. The thing is I love myself but I want to breath again and not have painful joints. This drug has helped me with 10lbs so far since late August. I'm just struggling with how long it's taking and the fear of failing. Overall, I don't ever want to be skinny, just a healthier curvier version of myself. Never in a million years would I see myself in the 100's. GW is 200-240lbs at 5'7"" :) 

no shame to those who want to be in the 100's though!

Overall, I don't ever want to be skinny, just a healthier curvier version of myself. Never in a million years would I see myself in the 100's. GW is 200-240lbs at 5'7"" :) 

no shame to those who want to be in the 100's though!

## Comment 
> Anyone here taking a weight loss medication called Ozempic? 

I was 340lbs last year and now I hover 296-297lbs depending on water weight. The thing is I love myself but I want to breath again and not have painful joints. This drug has helped me with 10lbs so far since late August. I'm just struggling with how long it's taking and the fear of failing. Overall, I don't ever want to be skinny, just a healthier curvier version of myself. Never in a million years would I see myself in the 100's. GW is 200-240lbs at 5'7"" :) 

no shame to those who want to be in the 100's though!

I was 340lbs last year and now I hover 296-297lbs depending on water weight. The thing is I love myself but I want to breath again and not have painful joints. This drug has helped me with 10lbs so far since late August. I'm just struggling with how long it's taking and the fear of failing. Overall, I don't ever want to be skinny, just a healthier curvier version of myself. Never in a million years would I see myself in the 100's. GW is 200-240lbs at 5'7"" :) 

no shame to those who want to be in the 100's though!

I was 340lbs last year and now I hover 296-297lbs depending on water weight. The thing is I love myself but I want to breath again and not have painful joints. This drug has helped me with 10lbs so far since late August. I'm just struggling with how long it's taking and the fear of failing. Overall, I don't ever want to be skinny, just a healthier curvier version of myself. Never in a million years would I see myself in the 100's. GW is 200-240lbs at 5'7"" :) 

no shame to those who want to be in the 100's though!

## Comment 
> Anyone here taking a weight loss medication called Ozempic? 

I was 340lbs last year and now I hover 296-297lbs depending on water weight. The thing is I love myself but I want to breath again and not have painful joints. This drug has helped me with 10lbs so far since late August. I'm just struggling with how long it's taking and the fear of failing. Overall, I don't ever want to be skinny, just a healthier curvier version of myself. Never in a million years would I see myself in the 100's. GW is 200-240lbs at 5'7"" :) 

no shame to those who want to be in the 100's though!
